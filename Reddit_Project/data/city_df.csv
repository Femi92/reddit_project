0,Rule Updates and Reminders - Title Formatting And Trolling Rival Subs,"Greetings City fans! 

Welcome to the Puma era, and welcome to the first day of the new football season. Isn't it good to be back?

While Zinchenko has been off stalking journalists in California, Mendy has been off sitting on a surgeons table in Barcelona ~~and Pep has been signing contracts in Turin~~, the mod team have been sitting back, can of Carabao in hand, relaxing and recharging, reflecting on the season we've just had.

Inevitably reflecting turns to an itchy desire to inflict our ideals on the community we ~~dictate~~ oversee.

Gabriel Jesus has claimed the number 9 shirt this summer, and to celebrate we thought we would introduce a ninth subreddit rule to commemorate this occasion.

-----

##New Rule - Posts must be descriptive, factual and relevant

There has been a notable decline in the quality of posts and titles recently, and we are looking to nip this in the bud as silly season steps up a gear.

Going forward we will be taking a closer look at posts and titles and removing those that do not meet minimum standards.

###Goals and Other Videos

Eg. Gabriel Jesus scores a goal at the Copa America. You wish to post this to to /r/mcfc and revel in the moment with your fellow City fans. There are a few ways you could post this to the community, but some are better than others:

**A goal should be posted as a video**. Not a screenshot of a goal, not self post with your hot take, not a self post with a link to the video inside. Just post the video as a link, either by uploading to reddit, or by linking to the streamable or alternative provider.

The title is important as well. We will remove poorly thought out titles. **Jesus SCORES A GOAL** will get removed. **Gabriel Jesus goal (1-0 vs Argentina) Copa America** or similar will allow your post to remain, and you will soak up all that sweet sweet karma

###Transfer Rumours, Articles

Going forward all titles must have the source in brackets, where relevant, to start off, for example:

&gt; **[SOURCE] Information (not your opinion) and direct link to either the twitter/article source.**

eg. This is what we are looking for:

&gt; [Sam Lee] Mendy Ruled out for entire season with knee issue

We will be removing posts like this:

&gt; What do we all think of this?

All transfer self posts will be deleted (unless it pertains to an actual discussion of a player rather than a rumour. All transfer related posts will be removed unless presented in the correct format with it being a link + source in brackets.

All **click-bait titles will be removed**. This will help all users quickly see the relevant information at a glance. 

Obviously there will be some small exceptions, please remember to add relevant information to the title and present it as a link to the source, then all is good.

###Match Threads (+ Pre/Post)

It should be obvious which posts are Match Threads and (the same goes for Pre and Post Match Threads).

Fancy starting a pre match thread? Feel free! Add the opponent and the competition to the title, add **[Pre Match Thread]** to the start, add some info to the description about the opponent and lets get the discussion going! The mods will sticky your post and everyone is happy.

Match Threads can be started by the community or with MatchThreader or LiveCommentator. The links for both and how to summon them are in the sidebar. If you do start a match thread yourself, add **[Match Thread]** to the title, and make sure to mention the team we're playing.

Post Match threads gets abused the most, the karma race can lead to some poor titles. We want **[Post Match Thread]** to be at the start, and we want to opponent and score in the title. Anything low effort will be removed, and we will favour a better formatted post. A description is helpful and if you're feeling adventurous, add some goals or highlights to the description.

It is not the responsibility of the mods to post any of these threads, you can do it if you wish. The mods will try and post them if nothing has happened.

###Pictures

We love seeing your pictures of your experience at the ground, or relevant pictures. They should be described properly though. if your picture just says something like **Check This Out!** then we will remove it. If you describe what is in the picture a bit, then we have no reason to remove it and the community know what they're getting before they click on the title. **Just a single emoji as the title is unacceptable.**

If you're going to post a picture of a key moment in the game, have a think about whether it would be better served as a video. The recent example that springs to mind is Jesus's penalty goal in the Copa America, which was posted as a screenshot from before he kicked the ball and offered no value.

###Players Social Media

Sometimes a player does something on social media and you want to post it to our sub. That's great, content is king. Follow the same rules as above. If Mendy has gone on a bender, a sentence explaining what his video contains is valuable information. **Mendy polishes Pep's head with shoe polish** tells me everything I need to know, I'm already salivating at the thought of watching this video. Just calling the video **Lol Mendy absolute bantz** is absolutely useless and will lead to removal.

###Overall

The golden rule is to think about what you're contributing to the community, an extra 10 seconds thinking about your title helps others engage with your content much more easily.

If in doubt, ask.

##Updated Rule - Trolling or Brigading of Rival Subreddits

We have removed a rule referencing the messaging of mods as it was a bit vague and not really enforceable. This has been replaced by a new rule about the trolling or brigading of rival subreddits. This is something we have been enforcing for a while, but not sits as one of our key rules to make yourself familiar with.

It is a simple rule. Any users found to be causing trouble on a rival subreddit, and who are reported to us by that subreddit, will risk being banned from that subreddit as well /r/mcfc as a result. We also report trolls to other subreddits.

This does not affect /r/soccer. Do what you want over there.

-----

##Other Business

A quick reminder of the other 7 rules that we have, they're all visible on the side bar, the link is called **Subreddit rules**.

As before we be removing any comments which are aggressive in nature (Rule: Don't be a dick), and any spam (Rule: Don't spam). Posts that have nothing to do with City will also be removed (Rule: Stay on topic). We are a lenient bunch, so if your post is about the CFG or a wider topic relevant to the club, that is acceptable. Got a really cool bot that you want to show off which says hi to people when they say ""I'm""? That is an unhelpful bot (Rule: No unhelpful bots). That earns the bot a ban.

You are allowed to give the club stick here, and you can complain or point out things you don't like. You can even have a discussion about the moral dilemma you've had to wrestle with by supporting a club owned by someone who is from the Middle East. What you can't do is come in with an anti-city attitude (Rule: No City-bashing). Opinions are fine and respected. Deliberate attempts to cause drama result in a ban.

It would be great if you could post in the relevant thread (Rule: Post in the relevant thread where possible), or create one if you feel it is needed. If there is already a thread about the new Puma kit (there is), then that is the best place for it. New material can have it's own post, and if it is related but warrants it's own post that is fine (like a new video showing Mendy hurting his knee in the new Puma kit). 

Finally, rival fans are still not welcome here, any kind of spamming or non-constructive comment will result in bans, and we do actively report the users to their home team subreddit (Rule: Rival fans must contribute constructively). If you're a rival fan and you genuinely want to ask a question or have a discussion, that is fine, we are a nice bunch. If you want to brag about your team's wonderful defender or point out that the club is financed by slavery, then I'm afraid you'll have to take that elsewhere.

-----

## And Finally

If you see any violations of these rules, please report them to the mods and we will take a look as quickly as possible. If you think you've been unfairly banned or had your post removed, speak to us and we will help resolve the issue.

We hope that you find these rules beneficial going forward and that they help to make the experience on /r/mcfc more enjoyable. As always, feel free to give the mods feedback on these changes.",MCFC

9,18/19 Player Reviews: A Crowdsourced Compilation [OC],"\[Satire Warning\]

&amp;#x200B;

Now that the season is well and truly over and the new season about to ramp up, I thought I'd take the time to review the players in the squad ahead of the new season. In order to do so, I have collated thousands of tweets, journalistic articles, opinion pieces and data points. I've taken terabytes of Opta data and fed all of this into an advanced AI neural network with machine learning, to come out with the average crowdsourced review of every player, based on fact.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goalkeepers**

&amp;#x200B;

Ederson

*A good goalkeeper capable of stopping shots with his body and also able to kick with his feet. Benefits from having an expensive defense ahead of him. Never been tested.*

Muric

*A goalkeeper. Never been tested.*

Bravo

*Round of applause*

&amp;#x200B;

**Defenders**

&amp;#x200B;

Walker

*A fast right footed player who benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. English. A liability. Never been tested.*

Danilo

*A former Real Madrid player. Never been played. 50 yard screamer sails over the bar*

Stones

*An English defender with girlfriend troubles. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Never been tested.*

Kompany

*Bald, swansong. Should have had contract torn up for taclking Salah sad face angry angry. Injured.*

Mendy

*Injured. Benefits from being in the most expensive knee surgery in the world.*

Delph

*In the dog house. English. Should be nowhere near Manchester*

Zinchenko

*Not a LB. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Never been tested.*

Mangala

*Ded.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Midfield**

&amp;#x200B;

Sane

*Wants to go to Bayern. Can't track back. Pep doesn't like him. Has a mother. Fast. Long hair.*

Sterling

*Black. Known to buy things. Breakthrough season. English. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world.*

Bernado Silva

*Only won 5 trophies. Can fill in for absentees. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world.*

Silva

*Old. Slow. Magic. Merlin. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world.*

De Bruyne

*De Injure*

Mahrez

*Waste of money. Bench warmer. £60 million on a substitute. Penalty miss.*

Fernandinho

*The second coming of Christ. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Tactical fouls. Shithouserey. Yellow card*

Gundogan

*Present. Not injured. DM. 8. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Turkish. German.*

Foden

*Not being given a chance. Does not benefit from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Should move to obscure German team*

&amp;#x200B;

**Fowards**

&amp;#x200B;

*Young. Offside. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Never scores. Only scores tap ins.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Manager**

&amp;#x200B;

Guardiola

*Fraud. Fourmidable. Juventus. Hates Sane. Bottles CL. Can't win withough Messi. Benefits from owning the most expensive squad in the world*",MCFC

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for the Premier League Champions scarves for every season city have won the league. Ideally 36/37, 67/68, 11/12, 13/14 (to be added to my 17/18 and 18/19 ones). Likely I will never find anything from 1937 or from 1968, so my main focus is on the 11/12 and 13/14 season. I want the scarves to be the specific League winning scarves that say champions and the year, or player lists (like 17/18) or some such thing...not just a standard scarf from those seasons.

Gundogan proved to be a perfectly capable backup, yet Pep continually started Dinho prior to his injury.  Often times against bottom table sides, cup matches, and in short turnarounds between matches. 

With the Rodri signing Pep will want to get them both of the pitch.

Ederson

Otamendi - Stones - Laporte

Bernardo - De Bruyne - Rodri - Gundogan - Sané

Jesus - Agüero 


First of all, I would love to see Gabriel Jesus and Agüero playing a full 90 match together. I’m not sure if it has happened before, but it would be interesting to see how the team would fare with two deadly strikers up front. Second of all, having two people like Rodri and Gundogan would offer a lot of defensive security with a line-up like this considering that the team would have a three man back line.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I will be visiting for a week on September 21st and are trying to determine the best way to make it to the Watford match at the Etihad.  Unfortunately, it looks like we will be on a tight schedule with our plane arriving at London Heathrow @ 10:45am.

&amp;#x200B;

We are wondering if you guys had recommendations on the best ways to get up to the game (right now it says 15:00 (3pm) game time) in a timely fashion.  

* We see that we should have train options that may leave Heathrow at 11:18am and arrive at Manchester Piccadilly at 14:47 (2:27pm).  
   * Is this a reasonable option, are trains usually pretty on time in the area (on a weekend?).  In America that is almost never the case.  
   * We are traveling with backpacks only.  Are there any places to store a backpack during the game?
   * Last time I was in London the customs/immigration went pretty quickly (about 20 minutes) but who knows?

&amp;#x200B;

* We could rent a car and drive up which appears to be about the same time commitment but our concern is about parking around the stadium and whether it is reasonable or if there are tips to parking just far enough away for it to make sense. Again, we are traveling with backpacks only but having a car gives us a place to store our belonging during the game.

&amp;#x200B;

* This one is kind of a long shot, but our friends live in Warrington and we could take the train to Warrington to arrive at 14:14 (2:14pm) and then try to drive the rest of the way (which would save us from having to rent a car and also give us a place to stash out backpacks)

&amp;#x200B;

We also have an option to try to get Everton tickets on the following weekend.  Is that a more reasonable request or should we focus our energy on getting to the Etihad?

**TL;DR** - the r/MCFC fantasy premier league is open for you to join! The code is **aeenuv**. You will have until Friday 09/08/19 to join then the league will be closed to new entrants. 

##Right lads!

I’m starting up the FPL league again for all you lovely people to sign up to. If you’ve never played Fantasy Premier League before the first thing you’re going to want to do is get yourself over to:

&gt; https://fantasy.premierleague.com

Second thing is to have a look around the site. They’ve got explanations of how to sign up and how the game is played. No point in me explaining it here because I’ll just be repeating what they say. It’s easy to follow. Millions of people play every season. 

Once you’re signed up you’ll want to join our league. *Best league in the land and all the world!* To do that, you’ll need a code. Our code this season is:

&gt; aeenuv

Once you’re joined in the league head back to the sub and brag **in this thread** about how awesome your team is. Mines already mint. I’ve got de Bruyne because he’s gonna boss it this season. There’s no rules on who you have in your team. If you want mid-table mediocrity to save a few mil then, sure, go for Pogba. Your mistakes are your mistakes. 

Just so we’re clear, this is for fun. There’s no fee to enter, it’s all free, and there are no prizes for winning. You’ll just win the knowledge that you’re basically the FPL version of Guardiola. Anyone finishing at the bottom, sorry, you’re basically Tony Pulis. 

Remember it’s just a laugh so don’t take it too seriously and don’t take 6 weeks to pick your team because you might just miss out. **I will be closing entry to the league the day the season starts ie 09/08/19.** You have been warned.

In the back 4, Walker has to fight Cancelo (if he comes, seems unlikely, but who knows).

If we sign Maguire than Stones will have to challenge him and Otamendi will fall on the 4th position.

If Mendy is fit, it will become Mendy vs Zinchenko for that spot.

Only person I can say is nailed Laporte and Ederson.

|HATE|David Luiz, Neymar, Coutinho, Alisson, Fabinho (not in squad?), Dani Alves|no one?! (used to hate Romero and Rojo but they wont play so all good)|Lots to hate in Brazil so will deduct 1 pt from them.|0-1|
|SPECIAL FACTORS|Brazil have a massive home advantage and will be extra motivated against their arch rivals and also to erase the 1-7 humiliation against Germany in WC2014 SF |Messi|Both get a point|1-2|

173,The new long term captain,"I've been thinking a lot about this since David Silva's announcement. Regrettably, I don't think Aguero and Fernandinho will be around for another 2 seasons. These are the three senior players I'd expect to be captain after Kompany however their short term solutions. That leaves the question of who?  They would need to be almost certain starters and have a big presence in the squad. Below are my reasons for and against 3 players that could be in contention. Comment below your thoughts  


**Kevin De Bruyne**

Loved by fans, time and time again Kevin has shown how important he is on the field. To many, he would be the ideal choice. For starters, he's a big game player, scoring winning goals against PSG, United, Chelsea for example. However, I can't help think back to one moment in 2017. Kevin 'loses his cool' at the end of a game against Napoli. Shouting ""Let me talk"" towards David Silva and Fernandinho. He's not afraid to show his emotions, reportedly being furious at Pep for subbing him off against Burton in January 2019. Was this just passion or could his frustrations land him in trouble while dealing with refs every game?

&amp;#x200B;

**Raheem Sterling**

Raheem's career seemed to have stagnated while under Manuel Pellegrini. Luckily for us, Pep Guardiola and influence from Mikel Arteta turned the player from 11 goals and 10 assists in 47 appearances to 25 goals and 18 assists in 51 appearances. But, numbers don't make a captain. In the last few months, he has shown great maturity off the pitch, Donating a large amount towards those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire and accusing the British media of fueling racism. However, do you think Raheem shows this level of maturity on the field? Well, he was given England captaincy for his 50th appearance. Gareth Southgate must see some leadership quality there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Aymeric Laporte**

Laporte played in 35/38 Premier League games last season. A rock at the back he never seems to complain and gets on with the job. A quality you would want from every player. At the moment he a certain starter above all the other centre backs at the club. Does his command at the back make the power defender capable to be the captain or is it too soon to tell in his early City career?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. I'm sure there are a lot more points for and against each of these players that ive not even touched on. Personally, for me it's between Kevin and Raheem however I feel both lack maturity on the field at the moment which can change in the next year in time for Davids departure Maybe could it even be someone else? John Stones? Bernardo Silva? or even Delph???",MCFC

218,Do we really need Maguire?,"With all the reports that have been flying around about us going for Maguire and paying £80m for him, potentially breaking the VVD record fee, I really feel we're going to be criminally overspending on an average defender.

I get Maguire is good and he's experienced and all that jazz. But is it really justified to spend 80m on him? No offence to whoever likes him, but he's really not worth more than 50m. We could easily promote Garcia or Sandler and give them the 4th choice spot, with Fernandinho stepping in when necessary. Dinho was great as a CB when he's been deployed there last season, he has the intelligence as well as the experience and physicality to excel there.

Also, there are a lot more defenders currently, who imo are as good, if not better than Maguire. Skriniar is one. Koulibaly is out of the picture for now sadly, though spending this much on him would be justified. Alderweireld is another really worth candidate. 

We could get Alderweireld for a measly sum who would give us enough backup for a good season which would give Stones and Laporte some more time to cement that partnership. It would also give us time to look at other better options in a year.

Seems we are not getting Koulibaly, which is a relief if you ask me. £107m is too much for a 28 year old centre back no matter how good he is. At least we know Mcguire can play in the prem, and very well as well. He is really comfortable on the ball and Pep is gonna make him even better!

With that said it would be crazy good if we can lower the price somewhat with offering Mendy and Otamendi (if he truly wants to leave).

The crazy rumors of him going to Juve that so many so called “Tier 1” italian journalists got wrong is probably him or Juve laying the groundwork and planting the seed for his eventual arrival, the same way Pep was rumored heavily in Pelligrini’s last season.

The arrival of Sarri to implement a similar style of play to Pep’s and to ease the transition from Allegri’s more rigid style, the same way Pelligrini was seen as a good transition to Pep from Mancini.

The future squad planning. This ones a bit of a reach but Pep was heavily rumored to have chosen Sterling, KDB and Sane while still being Bayern manager. The acquisition of De Ligt could be seen in a similar light and maybe could’ve been the deciding factor for him to join Juve ahead of Barca and co.

Now I couldn’t care less where Pep goes after he leaves us, he’s been absolutely brilliant for us and has took us to new heights I doubt we’ll see again in my lifetime, but if it does turn out that he’s planning for Juve while still being with us would that sour anyone’s opinion of him?",MCFC

Player Targets:

- Rodrigo **(should be done)**

- Maguire/ De Ligt/ Unknown (Otamendi Leaving Caveat)

- Cancelo (Danilo Leaving Caveat)

- Angelino **(should be done)**


Thats all the business I see City doing this window to be honest. I think Sane and Gundogan will stay. 

-------------------------

##  [](#icon-notes-big) **On to some history of Manchester Citys ruining football!**

lets take a look at our spend/net spend whatever you want to call it over the last 11 seasons of Sheik Mansour being in charge. I wont be counting this season coming as that would include THIS summer + the winter window. 


|Season|Expenditure|Income|Net|
:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Season 18/19|£69,750,000|£69,800,000|£50,000|
|Season 17/18|£272,200,000|£94,650,000|-£177,550,000|
|Season 16/17|£168,850,000|£3,800,000|-£165,050,000|
|Season 15/16|£152,100,000|£78,400,000|-£73,700,000|
|Season 14/15|£87,500,000|£27,500,000|-£60,000,000|
|Season 13/14|£103,200,000|£13,400,000|-£89,800,000|
|Season 12/13|£54,000,000|£40,000,000|-£14,000,000|
|Season 11/12|£76,000,000|£27,750,000|-£48,250,000|
|Season 10/11|£154,750,000|£38,750,000|-£116,000,000|
|Season 09/10|£125,000,000|£26,000,000|-£99,000,000|
|Season 08/09|£127,700,000|£14,800,000|-£112,900,000|
|||||
|||||
|Totals|£1,391,050,000|£434,850,000|-£956,200,000|


An average net spend of £88m over the last 11 seasons. I personally HATE net spend. Its for stupid people to use when in reality it ignores so many other pieces of how tranfers are worked on the books. In reality transfers account for a few things:

1) Length of contract

2) Transfer fee

3) Wages

4) Contract Expiry/Transfer Income when said player leaves

Thats how a transfer should be calculated. Looking at transfer at facevalue can be quite silly. To give an example of David Silva who lets say for this argument has been on £200k a week for the entire time he has been here. With a fee off £25m + 9 years at the club + 1 more. David Silva would have served 10 years. Thus his transfer fee on the actual books per accounting terms is 25/10 = a measly £2.5m per year due to amortisation. With 200k a week at £9.6m per year wages David Silva costs Manchester City on the books at £9.6m + £2.5m =£12.1m per year. This is one of the reasons City like to extend contracts early in their life so they can further spread the transfer fee over the life of the contract. So in reality the transfer fee of £2.5m per year starts of bigger and gets smaller of time. Its probably closer to £1-2m depending on when his extensions were signed. Gundogan for example who only has 1 year left on his contract per transfer fee amortisation we would have mostly paid off his transfer fee on the books and are almost only at wages. 

Hope thats not confusing!

----------------------

Alas back into our transfer books

The first 3 seasons of our spending in the Mansour era basically went unaccounted for. The owner was basically dumping money into the club left right and centre. A big chunk of our initial spend lies there with us spending a whopping **£483,450,000** in those first 3 seasons. This is what I call the ""catch up"" phase. There is no doubt in my mind that Manchester City squad was wayyy behind the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, and Arsenal. So we essentially had to spend a lot to catch up if we wanted to compete with the big clubs. This is the only time you could actually say City were ""ruining football"" and thats purely because the fees at the time were high and we had to spend over the odds to go quick. Though by the 11/12 season we had AGUERRROOOOOd our first PL title.  So fuck it!

## [](#icon-news-big) **FFP implications** 

Manchester City first started to get implications of potential FFP implications around 2011 to 2013 with an eventual fine and squad limitation in 2014. These same issues are cropping up again from the same time period - our books are good in the present but we might again get punished for wrong doings in 2014 (Can I get a fuck UEFA?). This is why in the seasons between 11/12 to 14/15 season we only had a net spend of £180m over 4 years. This is what Khaldoon described as a pinch that effectively slowed City down because they had to get legitimate streams of revenue to do any further club improvement as per the rules City were no longer allowed to get money from Mansour direclty anymore. 

So we effectively have had to do 2 catch up periods due to FFP. We caught up in 11/12 then stagnated back down. Although we won the PL in 2014 just take a look at the 3 seasons afterwards where we only 1 trophy during that period (league cup in 2016, can i get a fuck Liverpool?) as our squad was aging/not good enough. 


##  [](#icon-notes-big) **New TV money + commercial revenue hugely increased**


After that period we finally were able to freely spend again and with the coming of Pep Guardiola it was time to invest wisely in the squad and get back to the top. In the last 4 seasons we have spent a massive **£662,900,000** or a netspend of **£426,250,000**. A lot of opposing fans will tell you that we must be cheating or the owner is dropping money to do this. 

A netspend of £426,250,000 over 4 years is really not that much with the amount of revenue that comes in. The good thing about City is that the owners DO NOT take money out of the club at all. Every ounce it makes stays within the club. We also have 0 debt. In comparison take a look at what [Uniteds](https://i.redd.it/b4hxwon8ud531.jpg) owners are doing and yet are still able to have a netspend of around £300m in the same time period. 

## [](#icon-notes-big) **Looking at Individual Players** 

I have seen a lot of opposing fans like to claim that Citys buys have always been poor and they just go out and spend another 100m to fix the issue. 

Till this day our record Transfer fee is Riyad Mahrez at £60m 

In the Mansour era we have probably bought around 70-100 players into the first team and obviously most have left or been sold in that time frame. We have also bought a lot of youth who we are starting to see fees coming back from. 

### The bad and TBDs Over the last 11 years 

Suprisingly we havent done too many blunders in our years of spending. You can never nail every transfers for sure but I was acutally suprised how few we have got wrong since the takeover. 

|Players|Buy Fee|Rating|Sold Fee|Money Lost|Season @ City|On Loan|Fee Spread|
:--|--:|:--|--:|--:|:--|:--|--:|
|Benjamin Mendy|£52,000,000|TBD||TBA|2|0|£26,000,000|

|Stevan Jovetic|£25,800,000|Bad|£14,750,000|-£11,050,000|4|2|£2,762,500|
|Emmanuel Adebayor|£25,000,000|Bad|£5,000,000|-£20,000,000|4|3|£5,000,000|
|Jo|£18,000,000|Bad|£0|-£18,000,000|3|2|£6,000,000|
|Roque Santa Cruz|£17,500,000|Bad|£1,000,000|-£16,500,000|5|3|£3,300,000|
|Claudio Bravo|£17,100,000|Bad||TBA|3|0|£5,700,000|
|Javi Garcia|£16,000,000|Bad|£13,000,000|-£3,000,000|2|0|£1,500,000|
|Jack Rodwell|£15,000,000|Bad|£10,000,000|-£5,000,000|2|1|£2,500,000|
|Nolito|£13,800,000|Bad|£7,900,000|-£5,900,000|1|0|£5,900,000|
|Patrick Roberts|£11,000,000|Bad||TBA|4|4|£2,750,000|
|Scott Sinclair|£8,000,000|Bad|£3,500,000|-£4,500,000|3|2|£1,500,000|
|Totals|£311,700,000||£94,150,000|£137,450,000|||£79,895,833|


So over 11 years of transfers we have essentially lost £137m to bad transfers. With a lot of those contracts majority spending it out on loan so on the books we probably werent paying their wages but only the bad transfer fee.  (I made up the mangala sell fee of £5m because having that not count here is really bad lol)

The fee spread is a good way to visualise how much it roughly cost us per season on the books. 


Nothings hits me more than when opposing fans say we just buy any and every play at 40-50m and if they dont work we just buy another. Looking at this we have only had a few poor transfers in the last few seasons. Everything else was almost 5 seasons ago.

----------------------------------

## [](#icon-ball)[](#icon-net) **Some stats:**


- In the 11 years since the take over Manchester City have spent  £30m or more a total of only 15 times

- Over £40m a total of 8 times

- Over £50m a total of 4 times

- Over £60m a **grand total of 0 fucken times**

- Of players at or over £30m they have been demed good transfers 13 out of 15 times. Take out Mendy and itll go down to 12 out of 15 times. Thats a success rate of 87% -  pretty good if you ask me. 


With this youll see the club is in immaculately healthy position players and fee wise. 


So when opposing fans tell you Manchester City are ruining football. Tell them kindly to fuck off lol. 

Final note: Rodriguez is about to ruin my over £60m transfer fee due to his €70m release clause which due to current conversion rates becomes £62.1m (BOOOOO!!!) - Fuck it though he is going to be amazing and is only 22 years old. 5 years in when he is hitting his peak that fee will look tiny when Clubs will be paying £100m for Delph like players.",MCFC

292,Rodri stats compared to Fernandinho and Busquets,"Since yesterday I am hyped for Rodri and can't wait for him to sign for us. I was checking how well he would be suited to City and his stats say it all. I compared his 18/19 season with 17/18 Fernandinho and 15/16 Busquets. I believe 17/18 and 15/16 were the best seasons for Ferna and Busquets respectively. This is what I found

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Stat|Rodri (18/19)|Fernandinho(17/18)|Busquets(15/16)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|*Minutes*| 2743 | 2885 | **2906** |
|*Tackles per game*| **3** |1.8|2.9|
| *Fouls per game* |1.7|1.2| **0.9** |
| *Interceptions per game* |1.2|1.4| **1.9** |
| *Clearances per game* | **2** |1.9|0.7|
| *Dribbled past per game* | **1.1** |1.2| **1.1** |
| *Block Per Game* | **0.3** |0.2|0.1|
| *Key passes per game* |0.5| **0.6** | 0.5|
| *Dribbles per game* | **0.6** | **0.6** |0.3|
| *Dispossessed per game* |0.9| **0.6** |0.7|
| *Bad control per game* |0.6|1| **0.4** |
| *Passes per game* |56.7| **87.5** |69.2|
| *Pass success percentage* | **91.1** |90.1|89.8|
|Avg Rating (Whoscored)|7.24| **7.44** |7.28|

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From the above stats it is pretty evident that Rodri is defensively almost par with prime Fernandinho and Busquets whereas has scope for improvement offensively. Being 22 and with Pep as his coach, I am pretty confident he can only improve and will become one of the best DMs to have ever played. 

&amp;#x200B;

The standout stat for me is Bad control per game. I thought Fernandinho almost never had a bad touch and Rodri's stat is better than Ferna.",MCFC

Sounding optimistic we could have at least one in next week.

I would expect it to be Rodri.

Don't count out de Ligt just yet. The player has asked again about Pep and City.

There are hurdles (some are more obvious than others)

He's feeling the pressure a little in terms of all the interest. Worryingly, Liverpool have also started some sort of charm offensive.

Maguire is considered at least £20m too expensive and doesn't represent the value we want from making City's next centre half the most expensive in the world.

Mino certainly has food for thought.

If Leroy goes, Felix comes. Zinchenko and Walker new deals to be announced when they return.

Muric wanted on loan by two Premier League clubs.

Don't think Otamendi is leaving as things stand, maybe Vinny going has changed that.

No real update on Leroy. Bravo staying for final year.

With El Mago aged 33 and Fernandinho at 34 but still exceptional would you rather he was brought in as they get phased out, or keep the phenomenal talent they have regularly in the team and giving him the opportunity to be a premier league regular elsewhere?

If I'm not signed up as a Cityzen do I have any chance at getting tickets for this game? How long before the match do tickets typically go on sale online for Cityzens and/or General sale? Just looking for any advice you guys can give me about getting tickets as I don't really know how it works and what the demand is like (I assume it will be pretty high for this game as its the first home game of the season and its Tottenham).

Given the credible nature of some of these sources, what may be the case is Pep has already signed a forward contract with Juve that’s now sitting in a safe somewhere. What those terms and conditions are, we may never know. What we do know is this is exactly how it happened when Pep joined City from Bayern. Pep had already starting advising City on potential targets as early as a year before he joined. Starling the most famous one. 

Also, most people don’t remember this, but Bayern fans were shocked and left bitter Pep was leaving. Some players even admitted they were caught unaware. Especially after culling a CL /WC winning squad and never delivering the CL himself. Regardless of the trophies he brings in the coming 2 years, I doubt Pep will want to repeat anything like that again. When he says he is here for another 2 years, I believe him. But I don’t think he wants us to read too much into it beyond that. 

City is bigger than one man. Our competitive advantage comes from us being a well oiled machine. And that means being good at smoothing out transitions. I think that’s exactly what’s happening here.

The main points is:

1) City's owner is actually an investor who invests in lot of things (examples are given in the thread), including football. Hence this is an investment not a PR exercise. This is also supported by numbers that city is profittable lsat 4 years. The club value is estimated at 2.2 bn while he says the investment (total) is around 1.3 bn.

Kun Notes:

\- It's Kun...there's not a lot that you guys aren't well aware of.

\- Insanely consistent bagging 33, 30, then 32 goals. Minute totals of 3500, 2900, and 3400.

\- The threat of GJ was exactly what he needed.

\- Personal opinion for next season is that he plays slightly less minutes and hopefully puts up 34-40 goals as we start bedding in GJ. He could easily get 40+ rotation is obviously key.

&amp;#x200B;

Gabriel Jesus Notes:

\- Embracing the role of deputy with great morale which had to be difficult considering he was first choice not long after coming in on fire and especially with those two injuries.

\- Has a lot of work to do timing his runs and will get better as a finisher. We're blessed with Kun so I think that diminishes Gabby to a degree. The fact of the matter is that he scores goals when he plays and the squad doesn't significantly drop off either.

\- Constantly coming in as a SUB and without a long run of starts weakens his numbers but as a number 2 and potential long term replacement he's been perfect for us these past 2 and a half seasons and I'm not sure that we win two league cups and the FA without him.

\- There's been chatter over the years about fans not being sure if he can lead the line with Kun out and I'm 100% convinced that's bogus. There's also been chatter about not trust him for the big games and that also is 100% bogus. I ran the PL data on games he started / played over 45 minutes and it came back with a 30-4-1 record which is on pace for 102 points. I also ran though those games looking for matches vs top teams and he's excelled every time he's been given the chance. He's started Spurs away, Chelsea away, and vs LFC. We won all 3, he scored 3 and assisted 1. Obviously there was the cup final where he scored 2 and assisted 1 as well.

\- He's not ready yet but I hope he gets more chances in bigger games.

\- Personal Opinion for next season is that he gets close to 2800 minutes and threatens 30 goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Kelechi Notes:

\- Super bummed that it's not working out for him because he always seemed to get the job done when he was called upon. Obviously he had to leave but thanks Kelechi for missing that easy goal vs us!",MCFC

523,Man Utd and Man City make moves for Joao Felix in £120m battle with Real Madrid,"Manchester United and City are embroiled in a £120million tug of war with Real Madrid for Portugal whizkid Joao Felix.

Both Premier League clubs will have scouts watching Benfica teenager Felix in Portugal’s Nations League semi-final against Switzerland in Porto on Wednesday night.

United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has targeted Portugal’s latest footballing sensation as he begins the rebuilding of his team after a disappointing season.

But he faces fierce competition from Real, who are desperate to land the Benfica teenager, City and also Italian giants Juventus.

Benfica want around £120million and Real have already seen an opening bid of around £80m rejected.

But they are now expected to use Benfica’s interest in goalkeeper Keylor Navas to try to clinch a deal next week after the finals.

Felix, 19, scored 18 goals in 33 games for Benfica this season and became the youngest player to score a Europa League hat trick since Sergio Aguero when he netted three against Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter finals in April.

The teenager is set to make his senior debut for Portugal against the Swiss in Porto, after being called up for the finals by coach Fernando Santos

526,[Match Thread] Pep to Juventus - Announcement due 4th June,"**Venue:** Turin, Italy  
**Kick Off:** THE NEXT 24 HOURS GUYS  
**Referee:** /r/soccer  

-----

For the uninitiated, numerous very reliable Italian journalists, including the guy that same CR7 would go to Juventus, have stated that it is certain Pep Guardiola will be announced as Juventus manager on 4th June, with an official unveiling on 14th June. Join us for all the build up to this defining moment of the summer.

All we've had from City's side so far is unreliable guys like a board member and Pep Guardiola denying the claims, so without any credible sources, we can only assume that this is going ahead.

527,Mendy needs to be replaced or scared into reality,"Benjamin Mendy has only made 17 league appearances in his 2 years on the blue side of Manchester compared to his 1 year in ligue 1 with monoco where he made 8 more appearances with 25. In my opinion he is a liability and Pep Guardiola should highly consider out right replacing him or buying another left-back to put some fear in mendy. I could easily make the argument that with a healthy mendy the title race would've been a lot smoother and maybe we would be talking about champions league glory with that bum rushing, good crossing, and powerful option at left-back. Instead we had an out of position zinchenko at left-back which I must say he did a job but he wasn't mindblowing. It has been said Guardiola will be giving him another chance which I could get behind as long as we go out and buy someone to give him a run for his money. I would be very happy with buying a chilwell or a Tierney from Celtic this would get Mendy off of the social media and focusing on his fitness and his place in the squad. Also we must say the Premier league is a way more physical league then the French league he has already shown to be injury prone so we must get another recruit for that side of the back line. Just to finish this off I should let you know I am a fan of mendy and his abilities he obviously is a world class left back but if we want to continue our dominance in England and progressing in Europe I believe this is a problem position based on Benjamin's attitude and fitness. Anyone agree?",MCFC

Hoeness told the German press (Kicker) that it's about insane price-tags. Hence he does not see the move happening.

I looked at the stats...

Rashford scored 10 goals in 26 starts (one every 243 minutes) while Jesus was 7 in 8 (1 every 146 minutes) in the PL.

Rashford scored 2 goals in 8 starts (1 every 364 minutes) while Jesus was 4 in 4 (1 every 93.75 minutes) in the CL.

558,Man City identify three midfield summer transfer targets,"Source : Sky Sports


Manchester City are monitoring three midfielders as they continue their pursuit of a replacement for Fernandinho.

According to Manchester evening news, Atletico Madrid midfielder Rodri remains City's No.1 target but the Blues are not pinning all of their hopes on landing the 22-year-old.

Rodri has a release clause of €70million at Atletico but City are hopeful of signing him for a lower fee.

Should that not be possible City may look elsewhere, with Lyon's Tanguy Ndombele and Real Madrid's Marco Llorente both on the Blues' radar.
Ndombele shone for Lyon in their Champions League win at the Etihad at the beginning of the campaign.

Lyon reportedly rejected a bid from Tottenham for the 22-year-old midfielder earlier this week.

Llorente, meanwhile, endured an injury-ravaged campaign at Madrid and managed just 16 appearances in all competitions.

City are determined to sign Fernandinho's long-term successor this summer after losing out to Chelsea in their pursuit of Jorginho last year.
It had looked for all the world like the Italy international would move to the Etihad only for the lure of moving to London and working with Maurizio Sarri to turn his head at the 11th hour.

Fernandinho turns 35 next season and injury forced him to miss almost a quarter of City's Premier League games over the course of their title-winning campaign.

The Germany international Ilkay Gundogan proved himself to be an able deputy for Fernandinho in the run-in but there are doubts surrounding his long-term future at the club, despite his insistence that he is keen to renew his contract in Manchester.",MCFC

I've been watching him play since he signed for us,  he scores near post on such a consistent basis. A few notable ones that come to mind include his goals against Liverpool and United this season.

Another beauty that comes to mind is his [goal](https://youtu.be/vwjNySc58VA) against Liverpool in 2013 (can't find any better quality than this, unfortunately)

***Again you can write as much or as little as you want, it's your review anyway!***


Also since I haven't been subbed to this sub I can't comment it seems, that's a bit shit.


If you're curious about what they look like, [here was today's edition so that you can get a rough idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/bt5cds/201819_premier_league_season_in_review_leicester/)",MCFC
634,"Atletico are worried about a ‘soap opera’ developing over Rodri. Los Rojiblancos would like the situation sorted soon, whether that means a move to City or a new deal. Rodri is delighted with the idea of ​​playing in the Premier League and is very tempted by City.",,MCFC
635,Paratici confirms no contact with Pep,,MCFC
636,Better look at the new kit design,,MCFC
637,Would you be happy if City spent more than 100M on a player?,"I know we are labelled as the big spenders but we buy pretty efficiently (well since Pep, Mangala I am looking at you) and can't think of who we need that will strengthen us this summer. Only player I can think of is Kai Havertz, the kid looks something special and would be over 100m, there is obviously Mbappe but i think he has too big an ego for us lot. This has got me thinking because Joao Felix being labelled over 100m is shocking and I would be dissappointed if we pay that. 

Just an FYI - the major player we need to sign is De Ligt and just pay whatever just not over 100m (don't know what it is but triggers me being 3 digits)",MCFC
638,City abroad,"So i have been living abroad for over a year and havn’t been to a game since our trashing of spurs in December 2017. Missed so much but still watch when the time difference allows. Honestly I love the club and miss going to matcha  terribly but that’s life unfortunately. seen I saw that city are coming to near where I live on their summer tour got exited for like 5 minutes then realized I will be visiting back home when it’s on.... to say I’m mildly upset is an understatement

Edit: I’m an idiot, the point of this is to ask if other fans living abroad have similar issues or story’s to tell?",MCFC
639,Can we dead the whining?,"We’ve just won the domestic treble, had the best two seasons in history, we have a great core of players that will only get even better, and most of all we have one of the best managers of all time with us for at least another two years.

Despite this, I’m seeing a lot of pointless moaning. About not being on the front/back pages of papers. About Liverpool getting more credit for the season. About the media bias against City, and the criticism of our owners. Why does any of this matter? Who gives a shit whether we’re the headline in the Telegraph? Why are we arsed about what boring media heads talking about Liverpool more than us? Why do we automatically assume that reports on our ownership are hit pieces, when there are massive, legitimate concerns with them?

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve spent a lot of time rolling my eyes at BT and calling McManaman or whoever a twat (he is a fucking twat) but on here it’s endless complaining about bias and exposure, and it’s just sad to see.

I realise how hypocritical this post seems, but it’s just frustrating to see so little joy and so much bitterness, I think we could all do with just cheering up and blocking out the noise from the media, it doesn’t mean anything whatsoever.",MCFC

641,"IF sane leaves, do we sign a winger or midfielder?","As the title says. We're at a point now here sane leaving is very much a possibility. So with that in mind, and given bernardo's proficiency on the wing, should we be signing a midfielder to replace bernardo, or a winger to replace sane? 

I know we all envisioned bernardo as the dave heir, but it's very clear now that bernardo is not any worse, if not better, on the wing  which is also where pep likes him as of now. 

If we're getting winger, then we we're looking at a ridiculously expensive joao felix. I don't know how i feel about potentially paying more for felix than we're getting for sane. 

If we're getting a MF then there were the talks of bruno earlier that were debunked, as well as whispers tielemans this morning. I would also like to throw Kai Havertz in there. He's really talented and bayern's been after him for some time. Nothing would make me happier than sticking it to bayern after all the shenanigans their boards been pulling.

So what does everyone think? I'm hoping over everything else that he stays, but thought it might be worth having a discussion who we potentially want in.",MCFC
642,Dietmar Hamann: “City have got a huge hole to fill after Kompany's exit and there's only one candidate – Matthijs de Ligt. Sometimes you come across a freak and that's what De Ligt is; a 19-year-old who is built like a 25-year-old and plays like a 30-year-old...”,,MCFC

669,(Discussion) What should the squad focus on individually to improve next season?,"City have just completed another historic season but there is always room for improvement.  I am curious what everyone thinks the squad needs to improve on from an individual standpoint.  I have a couple of initial thoughts:

In general - defending corners and set pieces which has been poor for a couple of seasons now

Jesus - staying onsides and lower body strength/balance so he doesn't get pushed off the ball so easily

Mahrez - shot accuracy, too many balls 10 rows into the stands

Walker - better accuracy and timeliness with his crosses &amp; staying calm in high pressure situations

Sane - his attitude and work rate seems like they can be greatly improved

Mendy - staying healthy?",MCFC

Why have we signed for them for 10 years, that’s such a long time period. Kit deals are only increasing alongside the growth of the game. If the club continues on its current trajectory this deal is going to look terrible in 4 years.

689,City to win the major treble next season? Barcelona/Puyol comparison,"So this is a pretty random thought/comparison that came to me yesterday. I think Kompany and Carles Puyol are pretty comparable players in terms of leadership and what they mean to their club. Some may be worried their will be some sort of drop off, maybe a lack of leadership in the locker room in the coming season due to Kompany’s departure. I would like to remind you  Carles Puyol retired at the end of the 2013/14 season and Barcelona went on to win the Treble the following 2014/15 season, without Puyol.  It’s going to be a great opportunity for players like Sterling and De Bruyne to grow into bigger leadership roles like those in the Barcelona squad had to do without their long-time captain.

As you probably know we‘ve been heavily linked with Sané. I have been following him since his early Schalke days and I would love it if we signed him. I was pretty bummed out when we missed out on him.

Now to my question: you hear all kinds of different sources saying different things. Some say his relationship with Pep is not good and some say they get along fine. Some say he wants to return to Germany and some say he wants to have another go at City.

I think you guys know the most, since you‘re the fans of the club lol. So, what is Sané’s situation at City? Is there a possibility that he signs for Bayern in this transfer window? I know he won’t be cheap (£80m at the lowest but probably more like £100m) but I think we might be okay with paying that much for a German player with that kind of quality and ceiling.

Appreciate all the answers and good luck in the next season!",MCFC

|Year|Man City|Chelsea|Man United|Arsenal|Tottenham|Liverpool|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|2010|5|1|2|3|4|7|
|2011|3|2|1|4|5|6|
|2012|1|6|2|3|4|8|
|2013|2|3|1|4|5|7|
|2014|1|3|7|4|6|2|
|2015|2|1|4|3|5|6|
|2016|4|10|5|2|3|8|
|2017|3|1|6|5|2|4|
|2018|1|5|2|6|3|4|
|2019|1|3|6|5|4|2|
|Average|2.3|3.5|3.6|3.9|4.1|5.4|

We smash this out of the park! With my made up number system I'll give 6 points to City and count downwards from there to an updated table of:

|Team|Points|
:--|--:|
|Manchester City|21|
|Chelsea|19.5|
|Manchester United|11.5|
|Arsenal|7.5|
|Liverpool|2|
|Spurs|2|



The next thing I want to look at is top 4 finishes and top 6 finishes. To me if you aren't 1st, then 2nd, 3rd and 4th are pretty much equal as you all make the CL and win nothing. 5th and 6th generally means EL. On this system I'm doing a minus system of no CL =-0.2 

|Team|Points|
:--|--:|
|Manchester City|20.8|
|Chelsea|18.9|
|Manchester United|10.9|
|Arsenal|6.9|
|Spurs|1|
|Liverpool|0.8|



----------


One thing I haven't counted in this calculation is winning the EL I did factor this in for getting CL the next year (example United) but not sure what value to give the trophy? Maybe 1.5?

If so then next week there is the huge implication of Chelsea finishing above us for the team of the decade! And whoever loses the CL final finishes last  on my made up top 6 ladder. 

Hope you enjoyed let me know if I should add or remove anything, or something I've missed!

----------------------------- 

## **From a City point of view** 

------------------------ 

## [](#icon-star-big) Tier Gospel 

- [Man City official](https://twitter.com/ManCity) - The only one that really counts. 

## [](#icon-news-big) **Tier One** 

- [\[Sam Lee\]](https://twitter.com/Sammy_Goal) - Goal - General rule with Sam anything he puts in a tweet or in a reply dont treat it as Tier 1 news, treat it as 2-3+. Anything he prints in an article treat it as Tier 1 news. He has said this multiple times in other Tweets and on Podcasts. The same thing in podcasts hell say something but dont treat it as Tier 1, for example in the last 93:20 podcast he said he has heard rumors about Harry Kane being a City target and an Aguero replacement but wont print it because he just doesn't see it happening but the sources he has heard it off are quite reliable. /u/sammy_goal - he is also are local resident here. 

- [\[Martin Blackburn\]](https://twitter.com/SunMartinB) - The Sun (unfortunately) - Does not print much transfer news but is usually nailed on when he prints something. Youll notice his last tweet is him saying Pep will sign a 2 year extension back in 2017 keeping him for 5 years! 

- [\[Simon Mullock\]](https://twitter.com/MullockSMirror) - The Mirror - The same With Martin, doenst print much but when he does he generally is pretty close and nailed on and has a long history with the club, his articles generally get down-voted to oblivion on /r/soccer due to him from The Mirror which is generally tier 10.  similar to Martin as its The Sun. 

With Tier ones ive seen plenty of people say oh but they said we were in for this and that didnt happen so they are not reliable. 

Youll never see Sam, Martin or Simon ever say, this is ""done"" to City.  Youll see them say the club is interested or strongly believe they land their target. You need to always remember they are talking from the clubs perspective and how they feel as their sources are generally City sources. 

## [](#icon-news-big) **Tier Two** 

- [[Simon Stone (BBC)]](https://twitter.com/sistoney67) - More of a United reporter to be fair but he does get some news on City and is pretty reliable for us especially considering he is from the BBC. The guys above will usually report first and then Simon will afterwards 

- [[Duncan Castles]](https://twitter.com/DuncanCastles)- also more of a united supporter and an anti city one at that. He falls for me between tier 2 and 3. However we can’t ignore the strong sources he has and he especially has a strong link with Super agent Mendes who represents a lot of city players. 



## [](#icon-news-big) **Tier 3** 

- [\[Jose Alvarez Haya\]](https://twitter.com/10JoseAlvarez) - Spanish Correspondent to Man City - Jose was tier 2 last year, he's been dropped to tier 3. Was great with line up leaks which have stopped as the club put an end to it. Any news he leaks ajohr Aguero though treat it as tier one. He basically gets it from Aguero directly that's definitely been clear over the last 2 years 


**ITKS**

Some ITKs are much more reliable than others but ill bundle them all together as tier 3s ITKS to me are always the funnest because its always from a whisper of news and theres generally something to it but as they are not journalists so they really dont have a reliability and reputation to keep up so as always with ITK's take them with a grain of salt or go crazy over them.

- [BillyShears/Ahsan](https://twitter.com/9320pod) (93:20 pod)

For other clubs or OUTSIDE sources, example an Italian newspaper talking about a City target from an Italian club look at this as a [guide](https://np.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/bogkgn/transfer_rumour_reliability_guide_summer_2019/). Thanks to /u/spoofex.  If you see a spanish paper talking about a target in Germany going to City its usually bullshit. However a reliable Barcelona paper with ties to Txiki/Pep may have knowledge from anywhere so its always good to know that on a scale of reliability as well.

726,Nobody's laughing now as Manchester City become 'the biggest and the best',"It was nine years ago when Garry Cook, the former Manchester City chief executive, popped into the home of the club’s New York supporters branch for a pint.


‘The biggest and best football club in the world,’ he predicted. And the world laughed its head off. That Cook was speaking from the Mad Hatter Saloon merely added to the merriment.
City’s New York contingent now drink at a new and bigger location — Amity Hall. And beyond its environs, nobody’s laughing. Certainly not the rivals who saw Manchester City as bumptious parvenus, and Cook’s boasts as the words of a fool.


Cook is long gone but he knew what City were about from the start. He knew who he worked for and he knew the ambition and resources behind the club. And while the competition underestimated City, Cook did not.
The club’s increasingly outspoken reaction to UEFA’s investigation over financial fair play is based on the belief that it is part of a campaign against them orchestrated by members of the Premier League elite, particularly Manchester United.
If so, it is a campaign that is working. A conveniently timed leak of UEFA’s intention to charge Manchester City, and ban them from Europe, reset the news agenda within 24 hours of their title win.


Having completed the first domestic treble win, Pep Guardiola was as good as asked in his press conference if he was a crook, receiving illegal payments.
And all because City’s owners didn’t turn out to be the mad hatters of popular imagination.
Nobody minded their oil money enriching the league when it was failing to entice Kaka to Manchester, or missing out on Champions League football courtesy of Harry Redknapp’s Tottenham and a Peter Crouch goal. That was Cook’s City; that was 2010.
At Wembley on Saturday we saw what that club became. A 116-year-old record matched; a landmark achieved; the standards of excellence being set, the bars that have been raised.


City haven’t got a defender as expensive as Virgil van Dijk, a midfielder as costly as Paul Pogba, even a striker in the range of what Arsenal paid for Alexandre Lacazette. So do not be fooled. Other clubs spend, too — but perhaps not as wisely.
Guardiola is also a coaching visionary, getting extraordinary improvements from his players. That’s every bit as significant.
The protectionist FFP rules, meanwhile, have always been about keeping the established elite in place. Back in 2010, they thought they were untouchable, but that complacency has been exposed. Never forget the clubs who made football all about money in the first place.
What they really hate is City winning at their game.",MCFC

759,Gabriel Jesus Isn't Good Enough For City,"I feel like I've heard this sentiment, or something very similar expressed A LOT this season. Perhaps you've heard it too. Maybe you've even held that opinion yourself. Maybe you've even given voice to it.

It's wrong.

Let me just start by acknowledging a couple key facts.

1. He's missed a lot of chances, but the one thing great strikers do better than anyone else, is get chances. Eventually they go in. He led the Premier League with an xG of 1.15. Miles better than anyone else with at least as many minutes as he had in the League.
2. He's always offsides.

You can have all of those arguments you want, because I'm still going to overwhelm that argument with the only one that really matters for a center forward: production. So here it is, a big, heaping plateful of it. Eat your heart out.

&amp;#x200B;

At age twenty-two he scored 21 goals with 6 assists, averaging a goal or an assist every 83.4 minutes. Compare that to Marcus Rashford's 13/9, and then consider that he registered all of those goals in 1,038 fewer minutes than Rashford. Last season Jesus had a combined 17 goals and 5 assists across all competitions (G/A: 117.9min).

&amp;#x200B;

As for the argument that he only racked up goals in lesser competitions against lesser sides, consider that 11 of those goals and 3 of those assists came in the Premier League and Champions League. That's a goal or an assist every 99.6 minutes. That's not as good as Sergio Aguero's 85.4 this season, but it is pretty much as good, or better, than all of the other best attacking players in the Premier League managed in the PL and Europe. (

* Salah: 108.4
* Mane: 133.8
* Firmino: 137.9
* Aubamayang: 94.1
* Lacazette 102.1
* Hazard: 102.75
* Kane: 115.3
* Son: 119.3

&amp;#x200B;

Now recall that he's at least three years younger than every name on that last, and at least four years younger than all but one (Kane).

&amp;#x200B;

Want comps from the continents (goals + assists per minute in all comps)? How about some of the other best young attackers in Europe like: 

* Timo Werner: 100.3
* Vincius: 108.5
* Luca Jovic: 97.1
* Joao Felix: 92.45

Again, Jesus' mark stands at one every 83.4 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

No, he isn't as good as Kylian Mbappe, who's goal+assist rate of 62.07 feels like a video game glitch, but no one else is. If you're disappointed by Jesus, it's probably not because of HIM, it's probably because you (like me) have been spoiled by watching Sergio Aguero for the past eight years, a man who's a master of turning half chances into goals. Jesus has a long way to go if he's ever to fill that legends boots, and in all likelihood, he never will (because how many people are Aguero?) but that doesn't mean he isn't good enough for us, and it doesn't mean he isn't one of the three or four best young center forwards in the world.",MCFC

However, with two starting-quality center backs leaving the team, I would think that signing a quality central defender would be priority? 

If Otamendi is to leave as expected, our depth at central defender would be:

Laporte
Stones
Mangala
Garcia
Sandler

Two proven starters, one Batmangala, and two unproven U-21 players. Garcia looked quality in preseason but that can only count for so much. Don’t know much about Sandler. I don’t know how much you can expect these two players to step up in a season.

I know De Ligt would be the best case scenario, but I think that’s a pipe dream at this point. Do you think we sign one center back this offseason? Maybe two? And who?",MCFC

787,City's main transfer targets,"With Vinnie gone and Otamendi also likely to go we need atleast one world class CB. With Ferna and Dave are on their last legs, need to go for a DM atleast. Sane is a doubt :(, in that case need someone as a winger/wide forward.

* GK is sorted with Steffen joining
* RB if Danilo goes need someone who will be handy on either flank and won't mind the bench role. Kenny Lala of Strasbourg is a good shout. Don't think AWB will be a very good purchase as neither him nor Walker will be happy with the bench role. Someone with a hybrid RB/CB profile similar to Joe Gomez/Pavard might be handy.
*CB position needs to be filled in. If Ota is staying we need to go for De Ligt, if that's not working maybe Maguire (but will be very expensive). Ruben Dias being another option. I would also like Eric Garcia to be around and have a Fodenesque role. If ota is leaving I personally prefer some young bargain buy as a 4th CB.
*With Zin/Mendy/Laporte I guess we can atleast skip the need for a LB for one more season.

* DM is a must. I personally would like Rodri, if not NDombele. This should be our marquee signing. Whoever comes will be able to share the minutes with gundo and ferna.

* It seems at this point Gundo is gonna sign for a new contract. In that case I am happy with the CM options if Dave stays. KDB/Gundo for RCM spot which can be further reinforced by Bernardo whenever he is not playing in the flanks. LCM is for Gundo/Silva/Foden.

* If both Sane and Jesus stay we are good in the forward department. If one of them leaves we definitely need someone. I would like a wide forward profile Timo/Joao Felix as age might catch up Aguero at some point. Another wildcard option will be Sebastian Haller, who is valued around 35-40 mills.

*Another point is as Delph is almost certain to leave we need someone to fill the homegrown quota.

Part 2 of 2

And yet I choose to rebel against what an end wants to be. I choose to be grateful for the past but remain ambitious and driven for the future.
For the next 3 years, I will take up the role of Player-Manager of RSC Anderlecht. 
Belgium’s finest.  

This may come as a surprise to you. 
It’s the most passionate yet rational decision I’ve ever made.

As a footballer, I was born and raised at RSC Anderlecht. 
Since the age of 6, I have been one with that club.
A history of 34 league titles, they are second to none.

The background to this story…
Belgian entrepreneur Marc Coucke acquired the club from the Vanden Stock family in December 2017.
What followed was a post take-over set back for a club that seemed robust but proved fragile. 
Although the take-over triggered a positive new vibe, sporting results did not follow.

I stopped at their training grounds on my way to international duty last year. Just to say hello.
Coucke, the chairman, and Sports Director Michael Verschueren asked my opinion regarding the difficult situation the club was in.
I shared my thoughts and listened to their vision for the future: ambitious, courageous and determined to get back to n°1.
I offered my help, no strings attached, should they need it.

Later on in the season, newly appointed Technical Director Frank Arnesen joined and we organized some technical sessions on how to build a strong playing identity based on attractive, attacking football. 
RSCA has a tradition of having fantastic youth. 
You could say they have the past and the future, but struggle with the present.

Not so long ago, I took a call from RSC Anderlecht.
Quite unexpectedly, they offered me the position of Player-Manager. 
Michael and Frank explained to me in detail how they saw it working in practice. 
They had thought it through.
Mr. Coucke, the owner, pledged full support: time, budget, framework, staff, facilities … 
I was left not only impressed, but also intrigued by this sign of confidence in me. 
It got me thinking. 

The end of this season couldn’t be more memorable.
I have lived the dream here.  
I have learned so much the last 3 years.
From an incredible manager.
Pep Guardiola reignited my love for the game.
I’ve witnessed, participated, analyzed, absorbed, studied.
Man City play the football I want to play.
It is the football I want to teach and to see played.

I have decided to take up the challenge at RSC Anderlecht.
Player-Manager. 
I want to share my knowledge with the next purple generations.

808,What do you guys think about Mendy?,"I’m a United fan and I was genuinely wondering what do you guys think of Mendy? He has 15 appearances and won 4 trophies. 

Will he be in the first team if he stays injury free? It will zinchenko take his place at LB? How do you guys rate him?

Cheers!",MCFC
809,New CB?,"With Kompany and Otamendi gone, We would only have 2 cb's and 1 young prospect ( Eric Garcia ) 

Who will Pep bring in ?",MCFC
810,Vinny leaving could have a bright side,"Kompany leaving is a shock to everyone, but I do see a silver lining. He frees up a CB spot, and that could keep Otamendi here, although they are no where near the same locker room presence. Or, if De Ligt is not going to Barca, and Otamendi still leaves, then De Ligt could be a good option, and maybe even our future captain. Kompany taking over a player-manager role could mean him gaining experience, and then re-joining us after Pep. This is not whatsoever a good deal now, but I think we could be even better down the line with this.",MCFC
811,The Story of Vincent Kompany,"Vincent Kompany announces that he will leave after 11 years at the club. Our leader, when he first came he played in midfield. He was a decent player in midfield. Then dropped in deeper as a center back. As Former Manchester City Assistant Mark Bowen put it ""The two players were Pablo Zabaleta [who cost £6.45m from Espanyol, made over 300 appearances and helped win three titles, as many League Cups and an FA Cup] and Vinny Kompany”. “Straight away you could see he was a leader, a fantastic professional. He was a man’s man and, although he was a Belgian who had arrived from Germany, he spoke fluent English,” added Bowen. “He came across as a proper person, level-headed, someone who would immediately improve the club. Every time Manchester City needed someone to Step up, Vincent Kompany was the one. Our first title win in 44 years. A must win the game against Manchester United. He headed the only goal in that game for us to go and win on the last day of the season and the rest as they say his history. Our second premier league trophy in 2014. Vincent Kompany our captain was there again. Then the persistent injuries came. It's hurt everytime. Mentally it must have been exhausting for him. He came back everytime. He showed his true quality. Both on and off the pitch. Proper Centre half are a dying breed. Vincent Kompany represents the last of them. He perfectly combined strength and technique. Under Pep Guardiola, he's made an impact on the team in a different way less game time. However, every game he plays is a an 8/10 performance. The goal against Leicester City 45 yards away. Everyone in the stadium ""Don't Shot"". He for a second hesitate and then takes the shot on. The strike swerves into the top corner. He has a prominent place in Manchester City folklore.

Also sorry for the shameless plug I write for a page on Facebook known as Manchester City Fans Canada. I'm looking for other contributors for it.",MCFC
812,Celebration for Kompany.,"Just have got an idea.

What if all of ya Manchester boys and grils (I'm from Belgium so I can't realy take part in this) go ahead and buy a Kompany shirt (if you don't already have one) and next season, the first game all go ahead and wear it.
At the start of the game you can all show your back with the number 4 and Kompany's name on it.

Porbs never gonna happen, but still, I'd love it. I know Kompany would as well...",MCFC

I'm trying to remember which goal it was that Kompany scored in either 14/15 or 15/16 where he scored one of the first games of the season and then for his celebration he jumped on the barricade separating the fans from the pitch.

**Manchester City**

Key City midfielder Fernandinho has been sidelined since suffering a knee injury in the Manchester derby on April 24, and Guardiola said ""we'll see"" when asked if the Brazilian would be fit for the FA Cup Final.

Kevin De Bruyne is in contention after appearing as a late substitute at Brighton following a hamstring issue, while Claudio Bravo (Achilles) remains a long-term absentee.

Benjamin Mendy recently underwent further treatment in Barcelona as he continues to struggle with the after-effects of his latest knee injury.


**Watford**

Watford received good news on Monday as Jose Holebas saw his appeal against the red card received on the final day of the season against West Ham for a last-man foul on Michail Antonio upheld by the FA.

Player of the Season Etienne Capoue returned to the midfield on Sunday after recovering from a groin injury, with only Domingos Quina (shoulder) and Sebastian Prodl (knee) absent.

905,Philippe Sandler,"What do you think about Philippe? What role might he be able to take in near future? 

We bought him last summer and he didn’t really play yet. He is capable of playing cdm and cb which is very much what I would Pep expect to scout for (not that he personally made the decision to buy him, very unlikely). 

Obviously he is a young (Dutch) lad so I hope he can get more play time. He only played one season in his professional career yet. 

As far as I’m aware he’s pretty technical for a defender but that’s pretty much all I know about him. 

Ah, and Raiola is his agent. Despite him being a terrible person that might be a sign Philippe is a proper future prospect.",MCFC

920,Rule Updates and Reminders - Title Formatting And Trolling Rival Subs,"Greetings City fans! 

Welcome to the Puma era, and welcome to the first day of the new football season. Isn't it good to be back?

While Zinchenko has been off stalking journalists in California, Mendy has been off sitting on a surgeons table in Barcelona ~~and Pep has been signing contracts in Turin~~, the mod team have been sitting back, can of Carabao in hand, relaxing and recharging, reflecting on the season we've just had.

Inevitably reflecting turns to an itchy desire to inflict our ideals on the community we ~~dictate~~ oversee.

Gabriel Jesus has claimed the number 9 shirt this summer, and to celebrate we thought we would introduce a ninth subreddit rule to commemorate this occasion.

-----

##New Rule - Posts must be descriptive, factual and relevant

There has been a notable decline in the quality of posts and titles recently, and we are looking to nip this in the bud as silly season steps up a gear.

Going forward we will be taking a closer look at posts and titles and removing those that do not meet minimum standards.

###Goals and Other Videos

Eg. Gabriel Jesus scores a goal at the Copa America. You wish to post this to to /r/mcfc and revel in the moment with your fellow City fans. There are a few ways you could post this to the community, but some are better than others:

**A goal should be posted as a video**. Not a screenshot of a goal, not self post with your hot take, not a self post with a link to the video inside. Just post the video as a link, either by uploading to reddit, or by linking to the streamable or alternative provider.

The title is important as well. We will remove poorly thought out titles. **Jesus SCORES A GOAL** will get removed. **Gabriel Jesus goal (1-0 vs Argentina) Copa America** or similar will allow your post to remain, and you will soak up all that sweet sweet karma

###Transfer Rumours, Articles

Going forward all titles must have the source in brackets, where relevant, to start off, for example:

&gt; **[SOURCE] Information (not your opinion) and direct link to either the twitter/article source.**

eg. This is what we are looking for:

&gt; [Sam Lee] Mendy Ruled out for entire season with knee issue

We will be removing posts like this:

&gt; What do we all think of this?

All transfer self posts will be deleted (unless it pertains to an actual discussion of a player rather than a rumour. All transfer related posts will be removed unless presented in the correct format with it being a link + source in brackets.

All **click-bait titles will be removed**. This will help all users quickly see the relevant information at a glance. 

Obviously there will be some small exceptions, please remember to add relevant information to the title and present it as a link to the source, then all is good.

###Match Threads (+ Pre/Post)

It should be obvious which posts are Match Threads and (the same goes for Pre and Post Match Threads).

Fancy starting a pre match thread? Feel free! Add the opponent and the competition to the title, add **[Pre Match Thread]** to the start, add some info to the description about the opponent and lets get the discussion going! The mods will sticky your post and everyone is happy.

Match Threads can be started by the community or with MatchThreader or LiveCommentator. The links for both and how to summon them are in the sidebar. If you do start a match thread yourself, add **[Match Thread]** to the title, and make sure to mention the team we're playing.

Post Match threads gets abused the most, the karma race can lead to some poor titles. We want **[Post Match Thread]** to be at the start, and we want to opponent and score in the title. Anything low effort will be removed, and we will favour a better formatted post. A description is helpful and if you're feeling adventurous, add some goals or highlights to the description.

It is not the responsibility of the mods to post any of these threads, you can do it if you wish. The mods will try and post them if nothing has happened.

###Pictures

We love seeing your pictures of your experience at the ground, or relevant pictures. They should be described properly though. if your picture just says something like **Check This Out!** then we will remove it. If you describe what is in the picture a bit, then we have no reason to remove it and the community know what they're getting before they click on the title. **Just a single emoji as the title is unacceptable.**

If you're going to post a picture of a key moment in the game, have a think about whether it would be better served as a video. The recent example that springs to mind is Jesus's penalty goal in the Copa America, which was posted as a screenshot from before he kicked the ball and offered no value.

###Players Social Media

Sometimes a player does something on social media and you want to post it to our sub. That's great, content is king. Follow the same rules as above. If Mendy has gone on a bender, a sentence explaining what his video contains is valuable information. **Mendy polishes Pep's head with shoe polish** tells me everything I need to know, I'm already salivating at the thought of watching this video. Just calling the video **Lol Mendy absolute bantz** is absolutely useless and will lead to removal.

###Overall

The golden rule is to think about what you're contributing to the community, an extra 10 seconds thinking about your title helps others engage with your content much more easily.

If in doubt, ask.

##Updated Rule - Trolling or Brigading of Rival Subreddits

We have removed a rule referencing the messaging of mods as it was a bit vague and not really enforceable. This has been replaced by a new rule about the trolling or brigading of rival subreddits. This is something we have been enforcing for a while, but not sits as one of our key rules to make yourself familiar with.

It is a simple rule. Any users found to be causing trouble on a rival subreddit, and who are reported to us by that subreddit, will risk being banned from that subreddit as well /r/mcfc as a result. We also report trolls to other subreddits.

This does not affect /r/soccer. Do what you want over there.

-----

##Other Business

A quick reminder of the other 7 rules that we have, they're all visible on the side bar, the link is called **Subreddit rules**.

As before we be removing any comments which are aggressive in nature (Rule: Don't be a dick), and any spam (Rule: Don't spam). Posts that have nothing to do with City will also be removed (Rule: Stay on topic). We are a lenient bunch, so if your post is about the CFG or a wider topic relevant to the club, that is acceptable. Got a really cool bot that you want to show off which says hi to people when they say ""I'm""? That is an unhelpful bot (Rule: No unhelpful bots). That earns the bot a ban.

You are allowed to give the club stick here, and you can complain or point out things you don't like. You can even have a discussion about the moral dilemma you've had to wrestle with by supporting a club owned by someone who is from the Middle East. What you can't do is come in with an anti-city attitude (Rule: No City-bashing). Opinions are fine and respected. Deliberate attempts to cause drama result in a ban.

It would be great if you could post in the relevant thread (Rule: Post in the relevant thread where possible), or create one if you feel it is needed. If there is already a thread about the new Puma kit (there is), then that is the best place for it. New material can have it's own post, and if it is related but warrants it's own post that is fine (like a new video showing Mendy hurting his knee in the new Puma kit). 

Finally, rival fans are still not welcome here, any kind of spamming or non-constructive comment will result in bans, and we do actively report the users to their home team subreddit (Rule: Rival fans must contribute constructively). If you're a rival fan and you genuinely want to ask a question or have a discussion, that is fine, we are a nice bunch. If you want to brag about your team's wonderful defender or point out that the club is financed by slavery, then I'm afraid you'll have to take that elsewhere.

-----

## And Finally

If you see any violations of these rules, please report them to the mods and we will take a look as quickly as possible. If you think you've been unfairly banned or had your post removed, speak to us and we will help resolve the issue.

We hope that you find these rules beneficial going forward and that they help to make the experience on /r/mcfc more enjoyable. As always, feel free to give the mods feedback on these changes.",MCFC

929,18/19 Player Reviews: A Crowdsourced Compilation [OC],"\[Satire Warning\]

&amp;#x200B;

Now that the season is well and truly over and the new season about to ramp up, I thought I'd take the time to review the players in the squad ahead of the new season. In order to do so, I have collated thousands of tweets, journalistic articles, opinion pieces and data points. I've taken terabytes of Opta data and fed all of this into an advanced AI neural network with machine learning, to come out with the average crowdsourced review of every player, based on fact.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goalkeepers**

&amp;#x200B;

Ederson

*A good goalkeeper capable of stopping shots with his body and also able to kick with his feet. Benefits from having an expensive defense ahead of him. Never been tested.*

Muric

*A goalkeeper. Never been tested.*

Bravo

*Round of applause*

&amp;#x200B;

**Defenders**

&amp;#x200B;

Walker

*A fast right footed player who benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. English. A liability. Never been tested.*

*A former Real Madrid player. Never been played. 50 yard screamer sails over the bar*

Stones

*An English defender with girlfriend troubles. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Never been tested.*

*Injured. Benefits from being in the most expensive knee surgery in the world.*

Delph

*In the dog house. English. Should be nowhere near Manchester*

Zinchenko

*Not a LB. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Never been tested.*

Mangala

*Ded.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Midfield**

&amp;#x200B;

Sane

*Wants to go to Bayern. Can't track back. Pep doesn't like him. Has a mother. Fast. Long hair.*

Sterling

*Black. Known to buy things. Breakthrough season. English. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world.*

Bernado Silva

*Only won 5 trophies. Can fill in for absentees. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world.*

Silva

*Old. Slow. Magic. Merlin. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world.*

De Bruyne

*De Injure*

Mahrez

*Waste of money. Bench warmer. £60 million on a substitute. Penalty miss.*

Fernandinho

*The second coming of Christ. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Tactical fouls. Shithouserey. Yellow card*

Gundogan

*Present. Not injured. DM. 8. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Turkish. German.*

Foden

*Not being given a chance. Does not benefit from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Should move to obscure German team*

&amp;#x200B;

**Fowards**

&amp;#x200B;

Likely I will never find anything from 1937 or from 1968, so my main focus is on the 11/12 and 13/14 season. I want the scarves to be the specific League winning scarves that say champions and the year, or player lists (like 17/18) or some such thing...not just a standard scarf from those seasons.

Often times against bottom table sides, cup matches, and in short turnarounds between matches.

1003,What is a non-traditional City line-up that you would love to see?,"We know Pep loves his 4-3-3. There has been times though where he has changed it up a bit. Considering the deep squad the team has and how versatile a lot of the players are, what is one crazy line-up that you would like to see? For me it would be a 3-5-2 with the following people: 

Ederson

Otamendi - Stones - Laporte

Bernardo - De Bruyne - Rodri - Gundogan - Sané

Jesus - Agüero 


First of all, I would love to see Gabriel Jesus and Agüero playing a full 90 match together. I’m not sure if it has happened before, but it would be interesting to see how the team would fare with two deadly strikers up front. Second of all, having two people like Rodri and Gundogan would offer a lot of defensive security with a line-up like this considering that the team would have a three man back line. Overall, I just like the idea of seeing Jesus and Agüero playing together in a very offensive line-up.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I will be visiting for a week on September 21st and are trying to determine the best way to make it to the Watford match at the Etihad.  Unfortunately, it looks like we will be on a tight schedule with our plane arriving at London Heathrow @ 10:45am.

&amp;#x200B;

We are wondering if you guys had recommendations on the best ways to get up to the game (right now it says 15:00 (3pm) game time) in a timely fashion.  

* We see that we should have train options that may leave Heathrow at 11:18am and arrive at Manchester Piccadilly at 14:47 (2:27pm).  
   * Is this a reasonable option, are trains usually pretty on time in the area (on a weekend?).  In America that is almost never the case.  
   * We are traveling with backpacks only.  Are there any places to store a backpack during the game?
   * Last time I was in London the customs/immigration went pretty quickly (about 20 minutes) but who knows?

&amp;#x200B;

* We could rent a car and drive up which appears to be about the same time commitment but our concern is about parking around the stadium and whether it is reasonable or if there are tips to parking just far enough away for it to make sense. Again, we are traveling with backpacks only but having a car gives us a place to store our belonging during the game.

&amp;#x200B;

* This one is kind of a long shot, but our friends live in Warrington and we could take the train to Warrington to arrive at 14:14 (2:14pm) and then try to drive the rest of the way (which would save us from having to rent a car and also give us a place to stash out backpacks)

&amp;#x200B;

We also have an option to try to get Everton tickets on the following weekend.  Is that a more reasonable request or should we focus our energy on getting to the Etihad?

**TL;DR** - the r/MCFC fantasy premier league is open for you to join! The code is **aeenuv**. You will have until Friday 09/08/19 to join then the league will be closed to new entrants. 

##Right lads!

I’m starting up the FPL league again for all you lovely people to sign up to. If you’ve never played Fantasy Premier League before the first thing you’re going to want to do is get yourself over to:

&gt; https://fantasy.premierleague.com

Second thing is to have a look around the site. They’ve got explanations of how to sign up and how the game is played. No point in me explaining it here because I’ll just be repeating what they say. It’s easy to follow. Millions of people play every season. 

Once you’re signed up you’ll want to join our league. *Best league in the land and all the world!* To do that, you’ll need a code. Our code this season is:

&gt; aeenuv

Once you’re joined in the league head back to the sub and brag **in this thread** about how awesome your team is. Mines already mint. I’ve got de Bruyne because he’s gonna boss it this season. There’s no rules on who you have in your team. If you want mid-table mediocrity to save a few mil then, sure, go for Pogba. Your mistakes are your mistakes. 

Just so we’re clear, this is for fun. There’s no fee to enter, it’s all free, and there are no prizes for winning. You’ll just win the knowledge that you’re basically the FPL version of Guardiola. Anyone finishing at the bottom, sorry, you’re basically Tony Pulis. 

Remember it’s just a laugh so don’t take it too seriously and don’t take 6 weeks to pick your team because you might just miss out. **I will be closing entry to the league the day the season starts ie 09/08/19.** You have been warned.

In midfield we've got KDB, Silva, Bilva, Gundogan, Fernandinho, Rodri (new). Nobody seems nailed on in the midfield.

In the back 4, Walker has to fight Cancelo (if he comes, seems unlikely, but who knows).

If we sign Maguire than Stones will have to challenge him and Otamendi will fall on the 4th position.

If Mendy is fit, it will become Mendy vs Zinchenko for that spot.

Only person I can say is nailed Laporte and Ederson.

|HATE|David Luiz, Neymar, Coutinho, Alisson, Fabinho (not in squad?), Dani Alves|no one?! (used to hate Romero and Rojo but they wont play so all good)|Lots to hate in Brazil so will deduct 1 pt from them.|0-1|
|SPECIAL FACTORS|Brazil have a massive home advantage and will be extra motivated against their arch rivals and also to erase the 1-7 humiliation against Germany in WC2014 SF |Messi|Both get a point|1-2|

1093,The new long term captain,"I've been thinking a lot about this since David Silva's announcement. Regrettably, I don't think Aguero and Fernandinho will be around for another 2 seasons. These are the three senior players I'd expect to be captain after Kompany however their short term solutions. That leaves the question of who?  They would need to be almost certain starters and have a big presence in the squad. Below are my reasons for and against 3 players that could be in contention. Comment below your thoughts  


**Kevin De Bruyne**

Loved by fans, time and time again Kevin has shown how important he is on the field. To many, he would be the ideal choice. For starters, he's a big game player, scoring winning goals against PSG, United, Chelsea for example. However, I can't help think back to one moment in 2017. Kevin 'loses his cool' at the end of a game against Napoli. Shouting ""Let me talk"" towards David Silva and Fernandinho. He's not afraid to show his emotions, reportedly being furious at Pep for subbing him off against Burton in January 2019. Was this just passion or could his frustrations land him in trouble while dealing with refs every game?

&amp;#x200B;

**Raheem Sterling**

Raheem's career seemed to have stagnated while under Manuel Pellegrini. Luckily for us, Pep Guardiola and influence from Mikel Arteta turned the player from 11 goals and 10 assists in 47 appearances to 25 goals and 18 assists in 51 appearances. But, numbers don't make a captain. In the last few months, he has shown great maturity off the pitch, Donating a large amount towards those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire and accusing the British media of fueling racism. However, do you think Raheem shows this level of maturity on the field? Well, he was given England captaincy for his 50th appearance. Gareth Southgate must see some leadership quality there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Aymeric Laporte**

Laporte played in 35/38 Premier League games last season. A rock at the back he never seems to complain and gets on with the job. A quality you would want from every player. At the moment he a certain starter above all the other centre backs at the club. Does his command at the back make the power defender capable to be the captain or is it too soon to tell in his early City career?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. I'm sure there are a lot more points for and against each of these players that ive not even touched on. Personally, for me it's between Kevin and Raheem however I feel both lack maturity on the field at the moment which can change in the next year in time for Davids departure Maybe could it even be someone else? John Stones? Bernardo Silva? or even Delph???",MCFC

And I just can't see Cancelo being brought not to play a key role for us. He's a perfect type of attacking RB that Pep wants.

We all know Pep is always trying new ideas and new way to improve the team and I think playing 3ATB is his wet dream. If Mendy wasn't injured for all this time, I'm sure we'd see more of it.",MCFC

Bernardo due to how fucking sick he has been for us and what kompany has said about if he was less of a clown

Fernandinho has been with us for time and is floating around so he can pass messages throughout our whole team if you get me

And sterling because he seems very much invested in the club at this point and can fire up the players on the pitch when needed.

What do you guys think? Obviously I'm clouded by beer and just this season going but curious what fellow fans think will happen this season coming.

Adding Silva as an extra as I forgot about him but when he shows up he shows up and he's a fucking legend for our club!

I am slowly exploring the world of international soccer and would like to grow into being a Man City fan. What do I need to know about the team currently?

Where can I follow all the latest news and updates regarding the team besides reddit? Any YouTube recommendations?

Is the current state of the team a good one?

My friend is a Liverpool fan, but I don't want to cheer for same team.

************* *************************
Thanks to those who recommended different resources. Can't wait to dive right in.

As I said in the beginning, I want to grow into becoming a fan. I never said I was one. I am sure all of you have a starting point in your journey to becoming Manchester City fans. Well, mine started with seeing them live as my first international game ever and cheering opposite to my friend. I am hoping it evolves into me becoming a passionate fan like many of you.

I am not sure why I received some hostility, because every fan here had to start somewhere and I thought this community would welcome some one interested to know more with open arms. Then again, I realized this is reddit and some people are just perms butt hurt.

Thanks again for all the helpful people who actually provide useful info. Cheers",MCFC

1138,Do we really need Maguire?,"With all the reports that have been flying around about us going for Maguire and paying £80m for him, potentially breaking the VVD record fee, I really feel we're going to be criminally overspending on an average defender.

I get Maguire is good and he's experienced and all that jazz. But is it really justified to spend 80m on him? No offence to whoever likes him, but he's really not worth more than 50m. We could easily promote Garcia or Sandler and give them the 4th choice spot, with Fernandinho stepping in when necessary. Dinho was great as a CB when he's been deployed there last season, he has the intelligence as well as the experience and physicality to excel there.

Also, there are a lot more defenders currently, who imo are as good, if not better than Maguire. Skriniar is one. Koulibaly is out of the picture for now sadly, though spending this much on him would be justified. Alderweireld is another really worth candidate. 

We could get Alderweireld for a measly sum who would give us enough backup for a good season which would give Stones and Laporte some more time to cement that partnership. It would also give us time to look at other better options in a year.

Seems we are not getting Koulibaly, which is a relief if you ask me. £107m is too much for a 28 year old centre back no matter how good he is. At least we know Mcguire can play in the prem, and very well as well. He is really comfortable on the ball and Pep is gonna make him even better!

The crazy rumors of him going to Juve that so many so called “Tier 1” italian journalists got wrong is probably him or Juve laying the groundwork and planting the seed for his eventual arrival, the same way Pep was rumored heavily in Pelligrini’s last season.

The arrival of Sarri to implement a similar style of play to Pep’s and to ease the transition from Allegri’s more rigid style, the same way Pelligrini was seen as a good transition to Pep from Mancini.

The future squad planning. This ones a bit of a reach but Pep was heavily rumored to have chosen Sterling, KDB and Sane while still being Bayern manager. The acquisition of De Ligt could be seen in a similar light and maybe could’ve been the deciding factor for him to join Juve ahead of Barca and co.

Now I couldn’t care less where Pep goes after he leaves us, he’s been absolutely brilliant for us and has took us to new heights I doubt we’ll see again in my lifetime, but if it does turn out that he’s planning for Juve while still being with us would that sour anyone’s opinion of him?",MCFC

-------------------------

##  [](#icon-notes-big) **On to some history of Manchester Citys ruining football!**

lets take a look at our spend/net spend whatever you want to call it over the last 11 seasons of Sheik Mansour being in charge. I wont be counting this season coming as that would include THIS summer + the winter window. 


|Season|Expenditure|Income|Net|
:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Season 18/19|£69,750,000|£69,800,000|£50,000|
|Season 17/18|£272,200,000|£94,650,000|-£177,550,000|

|Season 08/09|£127,700,000|£14,800,000|-£112,900,000|
|||||
|||||
|Totals|£1,391,050,000|£434,850,000|-£956,200,000|


An average net spend of £88m over the last 11 seasons. I personally HATE net spend. Its for stupid people to use when in reality it ignores so many other pieces of how tranfers are worked on the books. In reality transfers account for a few things:

1) Length of contract

2) Transfer fee

3) Wages

4) Contract Expiry/Transfer Income when said player leaves

Thats how a transfer should be calculated. Looking at transfer at facevalue can be quite silly. To give an example of David Silva who lets say for this argument has been on £200k a week for the entire time he has been here. With a fee off £25m + 9 years at the club + 1 more. David Silva would have served 10 years. Thus his transfer fee on the actual books per accounting terms is 25/10 = a measly £2.5m per year due to amortisation. With 200k a week at £9.6m per year wages David Silva costs Manchester City on the books at £9.6m + £2.5m =£12.1m per year. This is one of the reasons City like to extend contracts early in their life so they can further spread the transfer fee over the life of the contract. So in reality the transfer fee of £2.5m per year starts of bigger and gets smaller of time. Its probably closer to £1-2m depending on when his extensions were signed. Gundogan for example who only has 1 year left on his contract per transfer fee amortisation we would have mostly paid off his transfer fee on the books and are almost only at wages. 

Hope thats not confusing!

----------------------

Alas back into our transfer books

The first 3 seasons of our spending in the Mansour era basically went unaccounted for. The owner was basically dumping money into the club left right and centre. A big chunk of our initial spend lies there with us spending a whopping **£483,450,000** in those first 3 seasons. This is what I call the ""catch up"" phase. There is no doubt in my mind that Manchester City squad was wayyy behind the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, and Arsenal. So we essentially had to spend a lot to catch up if we wanted to compete with the big clubs. This is the only time you could actually say City were ""ruining football"" and thats purely because the fees at the time were high and we had to spend over the odds to go quick. Though by the 11/12 season we had AGUERRROOOOOd our first PL title.  So fuck it!

## [](#icon-news-big) **FFP implications** 

Manchester City first started to get implications of potential FFP implications around 2011 to 2013 with an eventual fine and squad limitation in 2014. These same issues are cropping up again from the same time period - our books are good in the present but we might again get punished for wrong doings in 2014 (Can I get a fuck UEFA?). This is why in the seasons between 11/12 to 14/15 season we only had a net spend of £180m over 4 years. This is what Khaldoon described as a pinch that effectively slowed City down because they had to get legitimate streams of revenue to do any further club improvement as per the rules City were no longer allowed to get money from Mansour direclty anymore. 

So we effectively have had to do 2 catch up periods due to FFP. We caught up in 11/12 then stagnated back down. Although we won the PL in 2014 just take a look at the 3 seasons afterwards where we only 1 trophy during that period (league cup in 2016, can i get a fuck Liverpool?) as our squad was aging/not good enough. 


##  [](#icon-notes-big) **New TV money + commercial revenue hugely increased**


After that period we finally were able to freely spend again and with the coming of Pep Guardiola it was time to invest wisely in the squad and get back to the top. In the last 4 seasons we have spent a massive **£662,900,000** or a netspend of **£426,250,000**. A lot of opposing fans will tell you that we must be cheating or the owner is dropping money to do this. 

A netspend of £426,250,000 over 4 years is really not that much with the amount of revenue that comes in. The good thing about City is that the owners DO NOT take money out of the club at all. Every ounce it makes stays within the club. We also have 0 debt. In comparison take a look at what [Uniteds](https://i.redd.it/b4hxwon8ud531.jpg) owners are doing and yet are still able to have a netspend of around £300m in the same time period. 

## [](#icon-notes-big) **Looking at Individual Players** 

I have seen a lot of opposing fans like to claim that Citys buys have always been poor and they just go out and spend another 100m to fix the issue. 

Till this day our record Transfer fee is Riyad Mahrez at £60m 

In the Mansour era we have probably bought around 70-100 players into the first team and obviously most have left or been sold in that time frame. We have also bought a lot of youth who we are starting to see fees coming back from. 

### The bad and TBDs Over the last 11 years 

Suprisingly we havent done too many blunders in our years of spending. You can never nail every transfers for sure but I was acutally suprised how few we have got wrong since the takeover. 

|Players|Buy Fee|Rating|Sold Fee|Money Lost|Season @ City|On Loan|Fee Spread|
:--|--:|:--|--:|--:|:--|:--|--:|
|Benjamin Mendy|£52,000,000|TBD||TBA|2|0|£26,000,000|

|Claudio Bravo|£17,100,000|Bad||TBA|3|0|£5,700,000|
|Javi Garcia|£16,000,000|Bad|£13,000,000|-£3,000,000|2|0|£1,500,000|
|Jack Rodwell|£15,000,000|Bad|£10,000,000|-£5,000,000|2|1|£2,500,000|
|Nolito|£13,800,000|Bad|£7,900,000|-£5,900,000|1|0|£5,900,000|
|Patrick Roberts|£11,000,000|Bad||TBA|4|4|£2,750,000|
|Scott Sinclair|£8,000,000|Bad|£3,500,000|-£4,500,000|3|2|£1,500,000|
|Totals|£311,700,000||£94,150,000|£137,450,000|||£79,895,833|


So over 11 years of transfers we have essentially lost £137m to bad transfers. With a lot of those contracts majority spending it out on loan so on the books we probably werent paying their wages but only the bad transfer fee.  (I made up the mangala sell fee of £5m because having that not count here is really bad lol)

The fee spread is a good way to visualise how much it roughly cost us per season on the books. 


Nothings hits me more than when opposing fans say we just buy any and every play at 40-50m and if they dont work we just buy another. Looking at this we have only had a few poor transfers in the last few seasons. Everything else was almost 5 seasons ago.

## [](#icon-ball)[](#icon-net) **Some stats:**


- In the 11 years since the take over Manchester City have spent  £30m or more a total of only 15 times

- Over £40m a total of 8 times

- Over £50m a total of 4 times

- Over £60m a **grand total of 0 fucken times**

- Of players at or over £30m they have been demed good transfers 13 out of 15 times. Take out Mendy and itll go down to 12 out of 15 times. Thats a success rate of 87% -  pretty good if you ask me. 


With this youll see the club is in immaculately healthy position players and fee wise. 


So when opposing fans tell you Manchester City are ruining football. Tell them kindly to fuck off lol. 

Final note: Rodriguez is about to ruin my over £60m transfer fee due to his €70m release clause which due to current conversion rates becomes £62.1m (BOOOOO!!!) - Fuck it though he is going to be amazing and is only 22 years old. 5 years in when he is hitting his peak that fee will look tiny when Clubs will be paying £100m for Delph like players.",MCFC

1212,Rodri stats compared to Fernandinho and Busquets,"Since yesterday I am hyped for Rodri and can't wait for him to sign for us. I was checking how well he would be suited to City and his stats say it all. I compared his 18/19 season with 17/18 Fernandinho and 15/16 Busquets. I believe 17/18 and 15/16 were the best seasons for Ferna and Busquets respectively. This is what I found

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Stat|Rodri (18/19)|Fernandinho(17/18)|Busquets(15/16)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|*Minutes*| 2743 | 2885 | **2906** |
|*Tackles per game*| **3** |1.8|2.9|
| *Fouls per game* |1.7|1.2| **0.9** |
| *Interceptions per game* |1.2|1.4| **1.9** |
| *Clearances per game* | **2** |1.9|0.7|
| *Dribbled past per game* | **1.1** |1.2| **1.1** |
| *Block Per Game* | **0.3** |0.2|0.1|
| *Key passes per game* |0.5| **0.6** | 0.5|
| *Dribbles per game* | **0.6** | **0.6** |0.3|
| *Dispossessed per game* |0.9| **0.6** |0.7|
| *Bad control per game* |0.6|1| **0.4** |
| *Passes per game* |56.7| **87.5** |69.2|
| *Pass success percentage* | **91.1** |90.1|89.8|
|Avg Rating (Whoscored)|7.24| **7.44** |7.28|

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From the above stats it is pretty evident that Rodri is defensively almost par with prime Fernandinho and Busquets whereas has scope for improvement offensively. Being 22 and with Pep as his coach, I am pretty confident he can only improve and will become one of the best DMs to have ever played. 

&amp;#x200B;

The standout stat for me is Bad control per game. I thought Fernandinho almost never had a bad touch and Rodri's stat is better than Ferna.",MCFC

Sounding optimistic we could have at least one in next week.

I would expect it to be Rodri.

Don't count out de Ligt just yet. The player has asked again about Pep and City.

There are hurdles (some are more obvious than others)

He's feeling the pressure a little in terms of all the interest. Worryingly, Liverpool have also started some sort of charm offensive.

Maguire is considered at least £20m too expensive and doesn't represent the value we want from making City's next centre half the most expensive in the world.

Mino certainly has food for thought.

If Leroy goes, Felix comes. Zinchenko and Walker new deals to be announced when they return.

Muric wanted on loan by two Premier League clubs.

Don't think Otamendi is leaving as things stand, maybe Vinny going has changed that.

No real update on Leroy. Bravo staying for final year.

With El Mago aged 33 and Fernandinho at 34 but still exceptional would you rather he was brought in as they get phased out, or keep the phenomenal talent they have regularly in the team and giving him the opportunity to be a premier league regular elsewhere?

Given the credible nature of some of these sources, what may be the case is Pep has already signed a forward contract with Juve that’s now sitting in a safe somewhere. What those terms and conditions are, we may never know. What we do know is this is exactly how it happened when Pep joined City from Bayern. Pep had already starting advising City on potential targets as early as a year before he joined. Starling the most famous one. 

Also, most people don’t remember this, but Bayern fans were shocked and left bitter Pep was leaving. Some players even admitted they were caught unaware. Especially after culling a CL /WC winning squad and never delivering the CL himself. Regardless of the trophies he brings in the coming 2 years, I doubt Pep will want to repeat anything like that again. When he says he is here for another 2 years, I believe him. But I don’t think he wants us to read too much into it beyond that. 

City is bigger than one man. Our competitive advantage comes from us being a well oiled machine. And that means being good at smoothing out transitions. I think that’s exactly what’s happening here.

I am looking for a way to get city players to send me a video response saying happy birthday to her (Preferably a player she likes). I checked on all the websites I could like cameo and there were no City Players. I cant DM them on twitter begging either (Obv) so I thought maybe reddit would have some ideas or if anybody could help. I know this seems like ridiculous but you do some insane things for love sometimes.

Since I cant figure out how to respond (God I hate Reddit) If you think this is the only present im getting her you are sorely mistaken, I dont do cheap its all in or not at all. If they said pay a grand id pay a grand simple as that.

1) City's owner is actually an investor who invests in lot of things (examples are given in the thread), including football. Hence this is an investment not a PR exercise. This is also supported by numbers that city is profittable lsat 4 years. The club value is estimated at 2.2 bn while he says the investment (total) is around 1.3 bn.

&amp;#x200B;

Kun Notes:

\- It's Kun...there's not a lot that you guys aren't well aware of.

\- Insanely consistent bagging 33, 30, then 32 goals. Minute totals of 3500, 2900, and 3400.

\- The threat of GJ was exactly what he needed.

\- Personal opinion for next season is that he plays slightly less minutes and hopefully puts up 34-40 goals as we start bedding in GJ. He could easily get 40+ rotation is obviously key.

&amp;#x200B;

Gabriel Jesus Notes:

\- Embracing the role of deputy with great morale which had to be difficult considering he was first choice not long after coming in on fire and especially with those two injuries.

\- Has a lot of work to do timing his runs and will get better as a finisher. We're blessed with Kun so I think that diminishes Gabby to a degree. The fact of the matter is that he scores goals when he plays and the squad doesn't significantly drop off either.

\- Constantly coming in as a SUB and without a long run of starts weakens his numbers but as a number 2 and potential long term replacement he's been perfect for us these past 2 and a half seasons and I'm not sure that we win two league cups and the FA without him.

\- There's been chatter over the years about fans not being sure if he can lead the line with Kun out and I'm 100% convinced that's bogus. There's also been chatter about not trust him for the big games and that also is 100% bogus. I ran the PL data on games he started / played over 45 minutes and it came back with a 30-4-1 record which is on pace for 102 points. I also ran though those games looking for matches vs top teams and he's excelled every time he's been given the chance. He's started Spurs away, Chelsea away, and vs LFC. We won all 3, he scored 3 and assisted 1. Obviously there was the cup final where he scored 2 and assisted 1 as well.

\- He's not ready yet but I hope he gets more chances in bigger games.

\- Personal Opinion for next season is that he gets close to 2800 minutes and threatens 30 goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Kelechi Notes:

\- Super bummed that it's not working out for him because he always seemed to get the job done when he was called upon. Obviously he had to leave but thanks Kelechi for missing that easy goal vs us!",MCFC

1443,Man Utd and Man City make moves for Joao Felix in £120m battle with Real Madrid,"Manchester United and City are embroiled in a £120million tug of war with Real Madrid for Portugal whizkid Joao Felix.

Both Premier League clubs will have scouts watching Benfica teenager Felix in Portugal’s Nations League semi-final against Switzerland in Porto on Wednesday night.

United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has targeted Portugal’s latest footballing sensation as he begins the rebuilding of his team after a disappointing season.

But he faces fierce competition from Real, who are desperate to land the Benfica teenager, City and also Italian giants Juventus.

Benfica want around £120million and Real have already seen an opening bid of around £80m rejected.

But they are now expected to use Benfica’s interest in goalkeeper Keylor Navas to try to clinch a deal next week after the finals.

Felix, 19, scored 18 goals in 33 games for Benfica this season and became the youngest player to score a Europa League hat trick since Sergio Aguero when he netted three against Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter finals in April.

The teenager is set to make his senior debut for Portugal against the Swiss in Porto, after being called up for the finals by coach Fernando Santos

For the uninitiated, numerous very reliable Italian journalists, including the guy that same CR7 would go to Juventus, have stated that it is certain Pep Guardiola will be announced as Juventus manager on 4th June, with an official unveiling on 14th June. Join us for all the build up to this defining moment of the summer.

All we've had from City's side so far is unreliable guys like a board member and Pep Guardiola denying the claims, so without any credible sources, we can only assume that this is going ahead.

1447,Mendy needs to be replaced or scared into reality,"Benjamin Mendy has only made 17 league appearances in his 2 years on the blue side of Manchester compared to his 1 year in ligue 1 with monoco where he made 8 more appearances with 25. In my opinion he is a liability and Pep Guardiola should highly consider out right replacing him or buying another left-back to put some fear in mendy. I could easily make the argument that with a healthy mendy the title race would've been a lot smoother and maybe we would be talking about champions league glory with that bum rushing, good crossing, and powerful option at left-back. Instead we had an out of position zinchenko at left-back which I must say he did a job but he wasn't mindblowing. It has been said Guardiola will be giving him another chance which I could get behind as long as we go out and buy someone to give him a run for his money. I would be very happy with buying a chilwell or a Tierney from Celtic this would get Mendy off of the social media and focusing on his fitness and his place in the squad. Also we must say the Premier league is a way more physical league then the French league he has already shown to be injury prone so we must get another recruit for that side of the back line. Just to finish this off I should let you know I am a fan of mendy and his abilities he obviously is a world class left back but if we want to continue our dominance in England and progressing in Europe I believe this is a problem position based on Benjamin's attitude and fitness. Anyone agree?",MCFC

I looked at the stats...

Rashford scored 10 goals in 26 starts (one every 243 minutes) while Jesus was 7 in 8 (1 every 146 minutes) in the PL.

Rashford scored 2 goals in 8 starts (1 every 364 minutes) while Jesus was 4 in 4 (1 every 93.75 minutes) in the CL.

1478,Man City identify three midfield summer transfer targets,"Source : Sky Sports


Manchester City are monitoring three midfielders as they continue their pursuit of a replacement for Fernandinho.

According to Manchester evening news, Atletico Madrid midfielder Rodri remains City's No.1 target but the Blues are not pinning all of their hopes on landing the 22-year-old.

Rodri has a release clause of €70million at Atletico but City are hopeful of signing him for a lower fee.

Should that not be possible City may look elsewhere, with Lyon's Tanguy Ndombele and Real Madrid's Marco Llorente both on the Blues' radar.
Ndombele shone for Lyon in their Champions League win at the Etihad at the beginning of the campaign.

Lyon reportedly rejected a bid from Tottenham for the 22-year-old midfielder earlier this week.

Llorente, meanwhile, endured an injury-ravaged campaign at Madrid and managed just 16 appearances in all competitions.

City are determined to sign Fernandinho's long-term successor this summer after losing out to Chelsea in their pursuit of Jorginho last year.
It had looked for all the world like the Italy international would move to the Etihad only for the lure of moving to London and working with Maurizio Sarri to turn his head at the 11th hour.

Fernandinho turns 35 next season and injury forced him to miss almost a quarter of City's Premier League games over the course of their title-winning campaign.

The Germany international Ilkay Gundogan proved himself to be an able deputy for Fernandinho in the run-in but there are doubts surrounding his long-term future at the club, despite his insistence that he is keen to renew his contract in Manchester.",MCFC

I’ve just been relocated to Kansas City, MO for my job so I figured why not bring my City fandom with me by launching an official supporters club recognized by Man City.

Man City US have actually reached out on social media to get things up and running in order to be officially recognized in time for next season, so I wanted to see if anyone on here living in the vicinity of Kansas City wanted to join up!

If you’re interested, contact me via PM. I leave on vacation for a few weeks soon but I’m already working on setting up a home pub as well as some logo work and my mind is running wild with ideas.

1554,"Atletico are worried about a ‘soap opera’ developing over Rodri. Los Rojiblancos would like the situation sorted soon, whether that means a move to City or a new deal. Rodri is delighted with the idea of ​​playing in the Premier League and is very tempted by City.",,MCFC

1556,Better look at the new kit design,,MCFC
1557,Would you be happy if City spent more than 100M on a player?,"I know we are labelled as the big spenders but we buy pretty efficiently (well since Pep, Mangala I am looking at you) and can't think of who we need that will strengthen us this summer. Only player I can think of is Kai Havertz, the kid looks something special and would be over 100m, there is obviously Mbappe but i think he has too big an ego for us lot. This has got me thinking because Joao Felix being labelled over 100m is shocking and I would be dissappointed if we pay that. 

Just an FYI - the major player we need to sign is De Ligt and just pay whatever just not over 100m (don't know what it is but triggers me being 3 digits)",MCFC
1558,City abroad,"So i have been living abroad for over a year and havn’t been to a game since our trashing of spurs in December 2017. Missed so much but still watch when the time difference allows. Honestly I love the club and miss going to matcha  terribly but that’s life unfortunately. seen I saw that city are coming to near where I live on their summer tour got exited for like 5 minutes then realized I will be visiting back home when it’s on.... to say I’m mildly upset is an understatement

Edit: I’m an idiot, the point of this is to ask if other fans living abroad have similar issues or story’s to tell?",MCFC
1559,Can we dead the whining?,"We’ve just won the domestic treble, had the best two seasons in history, we have a great core of players that will only get even better, and most of all we have one of the best managers of all time with us for at least another two years.

Despite this, I’m seeing a lot of pointless moaning. About not being on the front/back pages of papers. About Liverpool getting more credit for the season. About the media bias against City, and the criticism of our owners. Why does any of this matter? Who gives a shit whether we’re the headline in the Telegraph? Why are we arsed about what boring media heads talking about Liverpool more than us? Why do we automatically assume that reports on our ownership are hit pieces, when there are massive, legitimate concerns with them?

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve spent a lot of time rolling my eyes at BT and calling McManaman or whoever a twat (he is a fucking twat) but on here it’s endless complaining about bias and exposure, and it’s just sad to see.

I realise how hypocritical this post seems, but it’s just frustrating to see so little joy and so much bitterness, I think we could all do with just cheering up and blocking out the noise from the media, it doesn’t mean anything whatsoever.",MCFC

1561,"IF sane leaves, do we sign a winger or midfielder?","As the title says. We're at a point now here sane leaving is very much a possibility. So with that in mind, and given bernardo's proficiency on the wing, should we be signing a midfielder to replace bernardo, or a winger to replace sane? 

I know we all envisioned bernardo as the dave heir, but it's very clear now that bernardo is not any worse, if not better, on the wing  which is also where pep likes him as of now. 

If we're getting winger, then we we're looking at a ridiculously expensive joao felix. I don't know how i feel about potentially paying more for felix than we're getting for sane. 

If we're getting a MF then there were the talks of bruno earlier that were debunked, as well as whispers tielemans this morning. I would also like to throw Kai Havertz in there. He's really talented and bayern's been after him for some time. Nothing would make me happier than sticking it to bayern after all the shenanigans their boards been pulling.

So what does everyone think? I'm hoping over everything else that he stays, but thought it might be worth having a discussion who we potentially want in.",MCFC

I am curious what everyone thinks the squad needs to improve on from an individual standpoint.  I have a couple of initial thoughts:

In general - defending corners and set pieces which has been poor for a couple of seasons now

Jesus - staying onsides and lower body strength/balance so he doesn't get pushed off the ball so easily

Mahrez - shot accuracy, too many balls 10 rows into the stands

Walker - better accuracy and timeliness with his crosses &amp; staying calm in high pressure situations

Sane - his attitude and work rate seems like they can be greatly improved

Mendy - staying healthy?",MCFC

I think Kompany and Carles Puyol are pretty comparable players in terms of leadership and what they mean to their club. Some may be worried their will be some sort of drop off, maybe a lack of leadership in the locker room in the coming season due to Kompany’s departure. I would like to remind you  Carles Puyol retired at the end of the 2013/14 season and Barcelona went on to win the Treble the following 2014/15 season, without Puyol.  It’s going to be a great opportunity for players like Sterling and De Bruyne to grow into bigger leadership roles like those in the Barcelona squad had to do without their long-time captain.

**Man City Season Review 18/19**

This final week is our season in review.

* How would you sum up our season?
* Your personal highlights? 
* Low points?
* Who stood out?
* Who needs to be given the boot?
* Did the season meet your expectations?
* Where do we need to strengthen?
* Is Kompany the greatest captain since birdseye himself?",MCFC

1626,"Hello guys, Bayern fan here","First of all: Congrats on winning the domestic treble. What an achievement.

As you probably know we‘ve been heavily linked with Sané. I have been following him since his early Schalke days and I would love it if we signed him. I was pretty bummed out when we missed out on him.

Now to my question: you hear all kinds of different sources saying different things. Some say his relationship with Pep is not good and some say they get along fine. Some say he wants to return to Germany and some say he wants to have another go at City.

I think you guys know the most, since you‘re the fans of the club lol. So, what is Sané’s situation at City? Is there a possibility that he signs for Bayern in this transfer window? I know he won’t be cheap (£80m at the lowest but probably more like £100m) but I think we might be okay with paying that much for a German player with that kind of quality and ceiling.

Appreciate all the answers and good luck in the next season!",MCFC
1627,[OC] Are Manchester City the team of the decade?,"Domestically I think we've taken the crown for the team of the decade! 

With my made up rules of CLx3 PL x2 , FA CUP x1.5 League cup X1

--:|:--|:--|:--|

|2017|Chelsea|Arsenal|Manchester United|
|2018|Manchester City|Chelsea|Manchester City|
|2019|Manchester City|Manchester City|Manchester City|



|Team|Points|
:--|--:|
|Manchester City|15.0|
|Chelsea|14.5|
|Manchester United|7.5|
|Arsenal|4.5|
|Liverpool|1.0|
|Spurs|0|

-------------------
the next logical thing to look at is consistency, and to do that we look at table finishes

Manchester city lead this by a staggering point and a bit. With an average finish of 2.3. 

|Year|Man City|Chelsea|Man United|Arsenal|Tottenham|Liverpool|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|2010|5|1|2|3|4|7|
|2011|3|2|1|4|5|6|
|2012|1|6|2|3|4|8|
|2013|2|3|1|4|5|7|
|2014|1|3|7|4|6|2|
|2015|2|1|4|3|5|6|
|2016|4|10|5|2|3|8|
|2017|3|1|6|5|2|4|
|2018|1|5|2|6|3|4|
|2019|1|3|6|5|4|2|
|Average|2.3|3.5|3.6|3.9|4.1|5.4|

We smash this out of the park! With my made up number system I'll give 6 points to City and count downwards from there to an updated table of:

|Team|Points|
:--|--:|
|Manchester City|21|
|Chelsea|19.5|
|Manchester United|11.5|
|Arsenal|7.5|
|Liverpool|2|
|Spurs|2|



The next thing I want to look at is top 4 finishes and top 6 finishes. To me if you aren't 1st, then 2nd, 3rd and 4th are pretty much equal as you all make the CL and win nothing. 5th and 6th generally means EL. On this system I'm doing a minus system of no CL =-0.2 

|Team|Points|
:--|--:|
|Manchester City|20.8|
|Chelsea|18.9|
|Manchester United|10.9|
|Arsenal|6.9|
|Spurs|1|
|Liverpool|0.8|



----------


One thing I haven't counted in this calculation is winning the EL I did factor this in for getting CL the next year (example United) but not sure what value to give the trophy? Maybe 1.5?

If so then next week there is the huge implication of Chelsea finishing above us for the team of the decade! And whoever loses the CL final finishes last  on my made up top 6 ladder. 

Hope you enjoyed let me know if I should add or remove anything, or something I've missed!

1634,[OC] Transfer Reliability Guide 2019 Summer Window,"Reposting my transfer Reliability Guide from last season as we approach silly season. I have updated some below and if you feel I need to change or update something let me know in the comments and I'll change it up 

----------------------------- 

## **From a City point of view** 

------------------------ 

## [](#icon-star-big) Tier Gospel 

- [Man City official](https://twitter.com/ManCity) - The only one that really counts. 

## [](#icon-news-big) **Tier One** 

- [\[Sam Lee\]](https://twitter.com/Sammy_Goal) - Goal - General rule with Sam anything he puts in a tweet or in a reply dont treat it as Tier 1 news, treat it as 2-3+. Anything he prints in an article treat it as Tier 1 news. He has said this multiple times in other Tweets and on Podcasts. The same thing in podcasts hell say something but dont treat it as Tier 1, for example in the last 93:20 podcast he said he has heard rumors about Harry Kane being a City target and an Aguero replacement but wont print it because he just doesn't see it happening but the sources he has heard it off are quite reliable. /u/sammy_goal - he is also are local resident here. 

- [\[Martin Blackburn\]](https://twitter.com/SunMartinB) - The Sun (unfortunately) - Does not print much transfer news but is usually nailed on when he prints something. Youll notice his last tweet is him saying Pep will sign a 2 year extension back in 2017 keeping him for 5 years! 

- [\[Simon Mullock\]](https://twitter.com/MullockSMirror) - The Mirror - The same With Martin, doenst print much but when he does he generally is pretty close and nailed on and has a long history with the club, his articles generally get down-voted to oblivion on /r/soccer due to him from The Mirror which is generally tier 10.  similar to Martin as its The Sun. 

With Tier ones ive seen plenty of people say oh but they said we were in for this and that didnt happen so they are not reliable. 

Youll never see Sam, Martin or Simon ever say, this is ""done"" to City.  Youll see them say the club is interested or strongly believe they land their target. You need to always remember they are talking from the clubs perspective and how they feel as their sources are generally City sources. 

## [](#icon-news-big) **Tier Two** 

- [[Simon Stone (BBC)]](https://twitter.com/sistoney67) - More of a United reporter to be fair but he does get some news on City and is pretty reliable for us especially considering he is from the BBC. The guys above will usually report first and then Simon will afterwards 

- [[Duncan Castles]](https://twitter.com/DuncanCastles)- also more of a united supporter and an anti city one at that. He falls for me between tier 2 and 3. However we can’t ignore the strong sources he has and he especially has a strong link with Super agent Mendes who represents a lot of city players. 



## [](#icon-news-big) **Tier 3** 

- [\[Jose Alvarez Haya\]](https://twitter.com/10JoseAlvarez) - Spanish Correspondent to Man City - Jose was tier 2 last year, he's been dropped to tier 3. Was great with line up leaks which have stopped as the club put an end to it. Any news he leaks ajohr Aguero though treat it as tier one. He basically gets it from Aguero directly that's definitely been clear over the last 2 years 


**ITKS**

Some ITKs are much more reliable than others but ill bundle them all together as tier 3s ITKS to me are always the funnest because its always from a whisper of news and theres generally something to it but as they are not journalists so they really dont have a reliability and reputation to keep up so as always with ITK's take them with a grain of salt or go crazy over them. 

- [MCFCJustSaying](https://twitter.com/MCFCjustsayin) - twitter ITK

- Tolmie - Bluemoon - ITK

- Ric - BlueMoon Admin

- [BillyShears/Ahsan](https://twitter.com/9320pod) (93:20 pod) 

- MCRJON - BM ITK - Godlike accuracy but hasn't posted since he said Kyle Walker is done in May 2017 (he signed in July...) and seeing Bernardo walk right past him at the CFA...

## **Not from a City point of view**

For other clubs or OUTSIDE sources, example an Italian newspaper talking about a City target from an Italian club look at this as a [guide](https://np.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/bogkgn/transfer_rumour_reliability_guide_summer_2019/). Thanks to /u/spoofex.  If you see a spanish paper talking about a target in Germany going to City its usually bullshit. However a reliable Barcelona paper with ties to Txiki/Pep may have knowledge from anywhere so its always good to know that on a scale of reliability as well.

1646,Nobody's laughing now as Manchester City become 'the biggest and the best',"It was nine years ago when Garry Cook, the former Manchester City chief executive, popped into the home of the club’s New York supporters branch for a pint.


‘The biggest and best football club in the world,’ he predicted. And the world laughed its head off. That Cook was speaking from the Mad Hatter Saloon merely added to the merriment.
City’s New York contingent now drink at a new and bigger location — Amity Hall. And beyond its environs, nobody’s laughing. Certainly not the rivals who saw Manchester City as bumptious parvenus, and Cook’s boasts as the words of a fool.


Cook is long gone but he knew what City were about from the start. He knew who he worked for and he knew the ambition and resources behind the club. And while the competition underestimated City, Cook did not.
The club’s increasingly outspoken reaction to UEFA’s investigation over financial fair play is based on the belief that it is part of a campaign against them orchestrated by members of the Premier League elite, particularly Manchester United.
If so, it is a campaign that is working. A conveniently timed leak of UEFA’s intention to charge Manchester City, and ban them from Europe, reset the news agenda within 24 hours of their title win.


Having completed the first domestic treble win, Pep Guardiola was as good as asked in his press conference if he was a crook, receiving illegal payments.
And all because City’s owners didn’t turn out to be the mad hatters of popular imagination.
Nobody minded their oil money enriching the league when it was failing to entice Kaka to Manchester, or missing out on Champions League football courtesy of Harry Redknapp’s Tottenham and a Peter Crouch goal. That was Cook’s City; that was 2010.
At Wembley on Saturday we saw what that club became. A 116-year-old record matched; a landmark achieved; the standards of excellence being set, the bars that have been raised.


City haven’t got a defender as expensive as Virgil van Dijk, a midfielder as costly as Paul Pogba, even a striker in the range of what Arsenal paid for Alexandre Lacazette. So do not be fooled. Other clubs spend, too — but perhaps not as wisely.
Guardiola is also a coaching visionary, getting extraordinary improvements from his players. That’s every bit as significant.
The protectionist FFP rules, meanwhile, have always been about keeping the established elite in place. Back in 2010, they thought they were untouchable, but that complacency has been exposed. Never forget the clubs who made football all about money in the first place.
What they really hate is City winning at their game.",MCFC

1679,Gabriel Jesus Isn't Good Enough For City,"I feel like I've heard this sentiment, or something very similar expressed A LOT this season. Perhaps you've heard it too. Maybe you've even held that opinion yourself. Maybe you've even given voice to it.

It's wrong.

Let me just start by acknowledging a couple key facts.

1. He's missed a lot of chances, but the one thing great strikers do better than anyone else, is get chances. Eventually they go in. He led the Premier League with an xG of 1.15. Miles better than anyone else with at least as many minutes as he had in the League.
2. He's always offsides.

You can have all of those arguments you want, because I'm still going to overwhelm that argument with the only one that really matters for a center forward: production. So here it is, a big, heaping plateful of it. Eat your heart out.

&amp;#x200B;

At age twenty-two he scored 21 goals with 6 assists, averaging a goal or an assist every 83.4 minutes. Compare that to Marcus Rashford's 13/9, and then consider that he registered all of those goals in 1,038 fewer minutes than Rashford. Last season Jesus had a combined 17 goals and 5 assists across all competitions (G/A: 117.9min).

&amp;#x200B;

As for the argument that he only racked up goals in lesser competitions against lesser sides, consider that 11 of those goals and 3 of those assists came in the Premier League and Champions League. That's a goal or an assist every 99.6 minutes. That's not as good as Sergio Aguero's 85.4 this season, but it is pretty much as good, or better, than all of the other best attacking players in the Premier League managed in the PL and Europe. (

* Salah: 108.4
* Mane: 133.8
* Firmino: 137.9
* Aubamayang: 94.1
* Lacazette 102.1
* Hazard: 102.75
* Kane: 115.3
* Son: 119.3

&amp;#x200B;

Now recall that he's at least three years younger than every name on that last, and at least four years younger than all but one (Kane).

&amp;#x200B;

Want comps from the continents (goals + assists per minute in all comps)? How about some of the other best young attackers in Europe like: 

* Timo Werner: 100.3
* Vincius: 108.5
* Luca Jovic: 97.1
* Joao Felix: 92.45

Again, Jesus' mark stands at one every 83.4 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

No, he isn't as good as Kylian Mbappe, who's goal+assist rate of 62.07 feels like a video game glitch, but no one else is. If you're disappointed by Jesus, it's probably not because of HIM, it's probably because you (like me) have been spoiled by watching Sergio Aguero for the past eight years, a man who's a master of turning half chances into goals. Jesus has a long way to go if he's ever to fill that legends boots, and in all likelihood, he never will (because how many people are Aguero?) but that doesn't mean he isn't good enough for us, and it doesn't mean he isn't one of the three or four best young center forwards in the world.",MCFC

1700,"With Kompany (and most likely Otamendi) leaving, how will we address our CB situation?","Every transfer rumor that I have heard so far has been around finding left back depth and a holding mid, which I agree are both important holes to address this offseason. However, with two starting-quality center backs leaving the team, I would think that signing a quality central defender would be priority? 

If Otamendi is to leave as expected, our depth at central defender would be:

Laporte
Stones
Mangala
Garcia
Sandler

Two proven starters, one Batmangala, and two unproven U-21 players. Garcia looked quality in preseason but that can only count for so much. Don’t know much about Sandler. I don’t know how much you can expect these two players to step up in a season.

I know De Ligt would be the best case scenario, but I think that’s a pipe dream at this point. Do you think we sign one center back this offseason? Maybe two? And who?",MCFC

1707,City's main transfer targets,"With Vinnie gone and Otamendi also likely to go we need atleast one world class CB. With Ferna and Dave are on their last legs, need to go for a DM atleast. Sane is a doubt :(, in that case need someone as a winger/wide forward.

* GK is sorted with Steffen joining
* RB if Danilo goes need someone who will be handy on either flank and won't mind the bench role. Kenny Lala of Strasbourg is a good shout. Don't think AWB will be a very good purchase as neither him nor Walker will be happy with the bench role. Someone with a hybrid RB/CB profile similar to Joe Gomez/Pavard might be handy.
*CB position needs to be filled in. If Ota is staying we need to go for De Ligt, if that's not working maybe Maguire (but will be very expensive). Ruben Dias being another option. I would also like Eric Garcia to be around and have a Fodenesque role. If ota is leaving I personally prefer some young bargain buy as a 4th CB.
*With Zin/Mendy/Laporte I guess we can atleast skip the need for a LB for one more season.

* DM is a must. I personally would like Rodri, if not NDombele. This should be our marquee signing. Whoever comes will be able to share the minutes with gundo and ferna.

* It seems at this point Gundo is gonna sign for a new contract. In that case I am happy with the CM options if Dave stays. KDB/Gundo for RCM spot which can be further reinforced by Bernardo whenever he is not playing in the flanks. LCM is for Gundo/Silva/Foden.

* If both Sane and Jesus stay we are good in the forward department. If one of them leaves we definitely need someone. I would like a wide forward profile Timo/Joao Felix as age might catch up Aguero at some point. Another wildcard option will be Sebastian Haller, who is valued around 35-40 mills.

*Another point is as Delph is almost certain to leave we need someone to fill the homegrown quota.

Part 2 of 2

And yet I choose to rebel against what an end wants to be. I choose to be grateful for the past but remain ambitious and driven for the future.
For the next 3 years, I will take up the role of Player-Manager of RSC Anderlecht. 
Belgium’s finest.  

This may come as a surprise to you. 
It’s the most passionate yet rational decision I’ve ever made.

As a footballer, I was born and raised at RSC Anderlecht. 
Since the age of 6, I have been one with that club.
A history of 34 league titles, they are second to none.

The background to this story…
Belgian entrepreneur Marc Coucke acquired the club from the Vanden Stock family in December 2017.
What followed was a post take-over set back for a club that seemed robust but proved fragile. 
Although the take-over triggered a positive new vibe, sporting results did not follow.

I stopped at their training grounds on my way to international duty last year. Just to say hello.
Coucke, the chairman, and Sports Director Michael Verschueren asked my opinion regarding the difficult situation the club was in.
I shared my thoughts and listened to their vision for the future: ambitious, courageous and determined to get back to n°1.
I offered my help, no strings attached, should they need it.

Later on in the season, newly appointed Technical Director Frank Arnesen joined and we organized some technical sessions on how to build a strong playing identity based on attractive, attacking football. 
RSCA has a tradition of having fantastic youth. 
You could say they have the past and the future, but struggle with the present.

Not so long ago, I took a call from RSC Anderlecht.
Quite unexpectedly, they offered me the position of Player-Manager. 
Michael and Frank explained to me in detail how they saw it working in practice. 
They had thought it through.
Mr. Coucke, the owner, pledged full support: time, budget, framework, staff, facilities … 
I was left not only impressed, but also intrigued by this sign of confidence in me. 
It got me thinking. 

The end of this season couldn’t be more memorable.
I have lived the dream here.  
I have learned so much the last 3 years.
From an incredible manager.
Pep Guardiola reignited my love for the game.
I’ve witnessed, participated, analyzed, absorbed, studied.
Man City play the football I want to play.
It is the football I want to teach and to see played.

I have decided to take up the challenge at RSC Anderlecht.
Player-Manager. 
I want to share my knowledge with the next purple generations.
With that, I will also put a bit of Manchester in the heart of Belgium.

This is no goodbye. It’s a see you later. 
Et pour les Mauves, voor alle Anderlecht fans: tot binnenkort, à très bientôt.

Love,

Vincent",MCFC

1730,Vinny leaving could have a bright side,"Kompany leaving is a shock to everyone, but I do see a silver lining. He frees up a CB spot, and that could keep Otamendi here, although they are no where near the same locker room presence. Or, if De Ligt is not going to Barca, and Otamendi still leaves, then De Ligt could be a good option, and maybe even our future captain. Kompany taking over a player-manager role could mean him gaining experience, and then re-joining us after Pep. This is not whatsoever a good deal now, but I think we could be even better down the line with this.",MCFC
1731,The Story of Vincent Kompany,"Vincent Kompany announces that he will leave after 11 years at the club. Our leader, when he first came he played in midfield. He was a decent player in midfield. Then dropped in deeper as a center back. As Former Manchester City Assistant Mark Bowen put it ""The two players were Pablo Zabaleta [who cost £6.45m from Espanyol, made over 300 appearances and helped win three titles, as many League Cups and an FA Cup] and Vinny Kompany”. “Straight away you could see he was a leader, a fantastic professional. He was a man’s man and, although he was a Belgian who had arrived from Germany, he spoke fluent English,” added Bowen. “He came across as a proper person, level-headed, someone who would immediately improve the club. Every time Manchester City needed someone to Step up, Vincent Kompany was the one. Our first title win in 44 years. A must win the game against Manchester United. He headed the only goal in that game for us to go and win on the last day of the season and the rest as they say his history. Our second premier league trophy in 2014. Vincent Kompany our captain was there again. Then the persistent injuries came. It's hurt everytime. Mentally it must have been exhausting for him. He came back everytime. He showed his true quality. Both on and off the pitch. Proper Centre half are a dying breed. Vincent Kompany represents the last of them. He perfectly combined strength and technique. Under Pep Guardiola, he's made an impact on the team in a different way less game time. However, every game he plays is a an 8/10 performance. The goal against Leicester City 45 yards away. Everyone in the stadium ""Don't Shot"". He for a second hesitate and then takes the shot on. The strike swerves into the top corner. He has a prominent place in Manchester City folklore.

Also sorry for the shameless plug I write for a page on Facebook known as Manchester City Fans Canada. I'm looking for other contributors for it.",MCFC
1732,Celebration for Kompany.,"Just have got an idea.

What if all of ya Manchester boys and grils (I'm from Belgium so I can't realy take part in this) go ahead and buy a Kompany shirt (if you don't already have one) and next season, the first game all go ahead and wear it.

**Manchester City**

Key City midfielder Fernandinho has been sidelined since suffering a knee injury in the Manchester derby on April 24, and Guardiola said ""we'll see"" when asked if the Brazilian would be fit for the FA Cup Final.

Kevin De Bruyne is in contention after appearing as a late substitute at Brighton following a hamstring issue, while Claudio Bravo (Achilles) remains a long-term absentee.

Benjamin Mendy recently underwent further treatment in Barcelona as he continues to struggle with the after-effects of his latest knee injury.


**Watford**

Watford received good news on Monday as Jose Holebas saw his appeal against the red card received on the final day of the season against West Ham for a last-man foul on Michail Antonio upheld by the FA.

Player of the Season Etienne Capoue returned to the midfield on Sunday after recovering from a groin injury, with only Domingos Quina (shoulder) and Sebastian Prodl (knee) absent.

Obviously he is a young (Dutch) lad so I hope he can get more play time. He only played one season in his professional career yet.

Welcome to the Puma era, and welcome to the first day of the new football season. Isn't it good to be back?

While Zinchenko has been off stalking journalists in California, Mendy has been off sitting on a surgeons table in Barcelona ~~and Pep has been signing contracts in Turin~~, the mod team have been sitting back, can of Carabao in hand, relaxing and recharging, reflecting on the season we've just had.

Inevitably reflecting turns to an itchy desire to inflict our ideals on the community we ~~dictate~~ oversee.

Gabriel Jesus has claimed the number 9 shirt this summer, and to celebrate we thought we would introduce a ninth subreddit rule to commemorate this occasion.

-----

##New Rule - Posts must be descriptive, factual and relevant

There has been a notable decline in the quality of posts and titles recently, and we are looking to nip this in the bud as silly season steps up a gear.

Going forward we will be taking a closer look at posts and titles and removing those that do not meet minimum standards.

###Goals and Other Videos

Eg. Gabriel Jesus scores a goal at the Copa America. You wish to post this to to /r/mcfc and revel in the moment with your fellow City fans. There are a few ways you could post this to the community, but some are better than others:

**A goal should be posted as a video**. Not a screenshot of a goal, not self post with your hot take, not a self post with a link to the video inside. Just post the video as a link, either by uploading to reddit, or by linking to the streamable or alternative provider.

The title is important as well. We will remove poorly thought out titles. **Jesus SCORES A GOAL** will get removed. **Gabriel Jesus goal (1-0 vs Argentina) Copa America** or similar will allow your post to remain, and you will soak up all that sweet sweet karma

###Transfer Rumours, Articles

Going forward all titles must have the source in brackets, where relevant, to start off, for example:

&gt; **[SOURCE] Information (not your opinion) and direct link to either the twitter/article source.**

eg. This is what we are looking for:

&gt; [Sam Lee] Mendy Ruled out for entire season with knee issue

We will be removing posts like this:

&gt; What do we all think of this?

All transfer self posts will be deleted (unless it pertains to an actual discussion of a player rather than a rumour. All transfer related posts will be removed unless presented in the correct format with it being a link + source in brackets.

All **click-bait titles will be removed**. This will help all users quickly see the relevant information at a glance. 

Obviously there will be some small exceptions, please remember to add relevant information to the title and present it as a link to the source, then all is good.

###Match Threads (+ Pre/Post)

It should be obvious which posts are Match Threads and (the same goes for Pre and Post Match Threads).

Fancy starting a pre match thread? Feel free! Add the opponent and the competition to the title, add **[Pre Match Thread]** to the start, add some info to the description about the opponent and lets get the discussion going! The mods will sticky your post and everyone is happy.

Match Threads can be started by the community or with MatchThreader or LiveCommentator. The links for both and how to summon them are in the sidebar. If you do start a match thread yourself, add **[Match Thread]** to the title, and make sure to mention the team we're playing.

Post Match threads gets abused the most, the karma race can lead to some poor titles. We want **[Post Match Thread]** to be at the start, and we want to opponent and score in the title. Anything low effort will be removed, and we will favour a better formatted post. A description is helpful and if you're feeling adventurous, add some goals or highlights to the description.

It is not the responsibility of the mods to post any of these threads, you can do it if you wish. The mods will try and post them if nothing has happened.

###Pictures

We love seeing your pictures of your experience at the ground, or relevant pictures. They should be described properly though. if your picture just says something like **Check This Out!** then we will remove it. If you describe what is in the picture a bit, then we have no reason to remove it and the community know what they're getting before they click on the title. **Just a single emoji as the title is unacceptable.**

If you're going to post a picture of a key moment in the game, have a think about whether it would be better served as a video. The recent example that springs to mind is Jesus's penalty goal in the Copa America, which was posted as a screenshot from before he kicked the ball and offered no value.

###Players Social Media

Sometimes a player does something on social media and you want to post it to our sub. That's great, content is king. Follow the same rules as above. If Mendy has gone on a bender, a sentence explaining what his video contains is valuable information. **Mendy polishes Pep's head with shoe polish** tells me everything I need to know, I'm already salivating at the thought of watching this video. Just calling the video **Lol Mendy absolute bantz** is absolutely useless and will lead to removal.

###Overall

The golden rule is to think about what you're contributing to the community, an extra 10 seconds thinking about your title helps others engage with your content much more easily.

If in doubt, ask.

##Updated Rule - Trolling or Brigading of Rival Subreddits

We have removed a rule referencing the messaging of mods as it was a bit vague and not really enforceable. This has been replaced by a new rule about the trolling or brigading of rival subreddits. This is something we have been enforcing for a while, but not sits as one of our key rules to make yourself familiar with.

It is a simple rule. Any users found to be causing trouble on a rival subreddit, and who are reported to us by that subreddit, will risk being banned from that subreddit as well /r/mcfc as a result. We also report trolls to other subreddits.

This does not affect /r/soccer. Do what you want over there.

-----

##Other Business

A quick reminder of the other 7 rules that we have, they're all visible on the side bar, the link is called **Subreddit rules**.

As before we be removing any comments which are aggressive in nature (Rule: Don't be a dick), and any spam (Rule: Don't spam). Posts that have nothing to do with City will also be removed (Rule: Stay on topic). We are a lenient bunch, so if your post is about the CFG or a wider topic relevant to the club, that is acceptable. Got a really cool bot that you want to show off which says hi to people when they say ""I'm""? That is an unhelpful bot (Rule: No unhelpful bots). That earns the bot a ban.

You are allowed to give the club stick here, and you can complain or point out things you don't like. You can even have a discussion about the moral dilemma you've had to wrestle with by supporting a club owned by someone who is from the Middle East. What you can't do is come in with an anti-city attitude (Rule: No City-bashing). Opinions are fine and respected. Deliberate attempts to cause drama result in a ban.

It would be great if you could post in the relevant thread (Rule: Post in the relevant thread where possible), or create one if you feel it is needed. If there is already a thread about the new Puma kit (there is), then that is the best place for it. New material can have it's own post, and if it is related but warrants it's own post that is fine (like a new video showing Mendy hurting his knee in the new Puma kit). 

Finally, rival fans are still not welcome here, any kind of spamming or non-constructive comment will result in bans, and we do actively report the users to their home team subreddit (Rule: Rival fans must contribute constructively). If you're a rival fan and you genuinely want to ask a question or have a discussion, that is fine, we are a nice bunch. If you want to brag about your team's wonderful defender or point out that the club is financed by slavery, then I'm afraid you'll have to take that elsewhere.

-----

## And Finally

If you see any violations of these rules, please report them to the mods and we will take a look as quickly as possible. If you think you've been unfairly banned or had your post removed, speak to us and we will help resolve the issue.

We hope that you find these rules beneficial going forward and that they help to make the experience on /r/mcfc more enjoyable. As always, feel free to give the mods feedback on these changes.",MCFC

Now that the season is well and truly over and the new season about to ramp up, I thought I'd take the time to review the players in the squad ahead of the new season.

Likely I will never find anything from 1937 or from 1968, so my main focus is on the 11/12 and 13/14 season.

Gundogan proved to be a perfectly capable backup, yet Pep continually started Dinho prior to his injury.  Often times against bottom table sides, cup matches, and in short turnarounds between matches. 

With the Rodri signing Pep will want to get them both of the pitch.

Ederson

Otamendi - Stones - Laporte

Bernardo - De Bruyne - Rodri - Gundogan - Sané

Jesus - Agüero 


First of all, I would love to see Gabriel Jesus and Agüero playing a full 90 match together. I’m not sure if it has happened before, but it would be interesting to see how the team would fare with two deadly strikers up front. Second of all, having two people like Rodri and Gundogan would offer a lot of defensive security with a line-up like this considering that the team would have a three man back line. Overall, I just like the idea of seeing Jesus and Agüero playing together in a very offensive line-up.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I will be visiting for a week on September 21st and are trying to determine the best way to make it to the Watford match at the Etihad.  Unfortunately, it looks like we will be on a tight schedule with our plane arriving at London Heathrow @ 10:45am.

&amp;#x200B;

We are wondering if you guys had recommendations on the best ways to get up to the game (right now it says 15:00 (3pm) game time) in a timely fashion.  

* We see that we should have train options that may leave Heathrow at 11:18am and arrive at Manchester Piccadilly at 14:47 (2:27pm).  
   * Is this a reasonable option, are trains usually pretty on time in the area (on a weekend?).  In America that is almost never the case.  
   * We are traveling with backpacks only.  Are there any places to store a backpack during the game?
   * Last time I was in London the customs/immigration went pretty quickly (about 20 minutes) but who knows?

&amp;#x200B;

* We could rent a car and drive up which appears to be about the same time commitment but our concern is about parking around the stadium and whether it is reasonable or if there are tips to parking just far enough away for it to make sense. Again, we are traveling with backpacks only but having a car gives us a place to store our belonging during the game.

&amp;#x200B;

* This one is kind of a long shot, but our friends live in Warrington and we could take the train to Warrington to arrive at 14:14 (2:14pm) and then try to drive the rest of the way (which would save us from having to rent a car and also give us a place to stash out backpacks)

&amp;#x200B;

We also have an option to try to get Everton tickets on the following weekend.  Is that a more reasonable request or should we focus our energy on getting to the Etihad?

**TL;DR** - the r/MCFC fantasy premier league is open for you to join! The code is **aeenuv**. You will have until Friday 09/08/19 to join then the league will be closed to new entrants. 

##Right lads!

I’m starting up the FPL league again for all you lovely people to sign up to. If you’ve never played Fantasy Premier League before the first thing you’re going to want to do is get yourself over to:

&gt; https://fantasy.premierleague.com

Second thing is to have a look around the site. They’ve got explanations of how to sign up and how the game is played. No point in me explaining it here because I’ll just be repeating what they say. It’s easy to follow. Millions of people play every season. 

Once you’re signed up you’ll want to join our league. *Best league in the land and all the world!* To do that, you’ll need a code. Our code this season is:

&gt; aeenuv

Once you’re joined in the league head back to the sub and brag **in this thread** about how awesome your team is. Mines already mint. I’ve got de Bruyne because he’s gonna boss it this season. There’s no rules on who you have in your team. If you want mid-table mediocrity to save a few mil then, sure, go for Pogba. Your mistakes are your mistakes. 

Just so we’re clear, this is for fun. There’s no fee to enter, it’s all free, and there are no prizes for winning. You’ll just win the knowledge that you’re basically the FPL version of Guardiola. Anyone finishing at the bottom, sorry, you’re basically Tony Pulis. 

Remember it’s just a laugh so don’t take it too seriously and don’t take 6 weeks to pick your team because you might just miss out. **I will be closing entry to the league the day the season starts ie 09/08/19.** You have been warned.

If we sign Maguire than Stones will have to challenge him and Otamendi will fall on the 4th position.

If Mendy is fit, it will become Mendy vs Zinchenko for that spot.

2013,The new long term captain,"I've been thinking a lot about this since David Silva's announcement. Regrettably, I don't think Aguero and Fernandinho will be around for another 2 seasons. These are the three senior players I'd expect to be captain after Kompany however their short term solutions. That leaves the question of who?  They would need to be almost certain starters and have a big presence in the squad. Below are my reasons for and against 3 players that could be in contention. Comment below your thoughts  


**Kevin De Bruyne**

Loved by fans, time and time again Kevin has shown how important he is on the field. To many, he would be the ideal choice. For starters, he's a big game player, scoring winning goals against PSG, United, Chelsea for example. However, I can't help think back to one moment in 2017. Kevin 'loses his cool' at the end of a game against Napoli. Shouting ""Let me talk"" towards David Silva and Fernandinho. He's not afraid to show his emotions, reportedly being furious at Pep for subbing him off against Burton in January 2019. Was this just passion or could his frustrations land him in trouble while dealing with refs every game?

&amp;#x200B;

**Raheem Sterling**

Raheem's career seemed to have stagnated while under Manuel Pellegrini. Luckily for us, Pep Guardiola and influence from Mikel Arteta turned the player from 11 goals and 10 assists in 47 appearances to 25 goals and 18 assists in 51 appearances. But, numbers don't make a captain. In the last few months, he has shown great maturity off the pitch, Donating a large amount towards those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire and accusing the British media of fueling racism. However, do you think Raheem shows this level of maturity on the field? Well, he was given England captaincy for his 50th appearance. Gareth Southgate must see some leadership quality there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Aymeric Laporte**

Laporte played in 35/38 Premier League games last season. A rock at the back he never seems to complain and gets on with the job. A quality you would want from every player. At the moment he a certain starter above all the other centre backs at the club. Does his command at the back make the power defender capable to be the captain or is it too soon to tell in his early City career?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. I'm sure there are a lot more points for and against each of these players that ive not even touched on. Personally, for me it's between Kevin and Raheem however I feel both lack maturity on the field at the moment which can change in the next year in time for Davids departure Maybe could it even be someone else? John Stones? Bernardo Silva? or even Delph???",MCFC

Fernandinho has been with us for time and is floating around so he can pass messages throughout our whole team if you get me

And sterling because he seems very much invested in the club at this point and can fire up the players on the pitch when needed.

2058,Do we really need Maguire?,"With all the reports that have been flying around about us going for Maguire and paying £80m for him, potentially breaking the VVD record fee, I really feel we're going to be criminally overspending on an average defender.

I get Maguire is good and he's experienced and all that jazz. But is it really justified to spend 80m on him? No offence to whoever likes him, but he's really not worth more than 50m. We could easily promote Garcia or Sandler and give them the 4th choice spot, with Fernandinho stepping in when necessary. Dinho was great as a CB when he's been deployed there last season, he has the intelligence as well as the experience and physicality to excel there.

Also, there are a lot more defenders currently, who imo are as good, if not better than Maguire. Skriniar is one. Koulibaly is out of the picture for now sadly, though spending this much on him would be justified. Alderweireld is another really worth candidate. 

We could get Alderweireld for a measly sum who would give us enough backup for a good season which would give Stones and Laporte some more time to cement that partnership. It would also give us time to look at other better options in a year.

Seems we are not getting Koulibaly, which is a relief if you ask me. £107m is too much for a 28 year old centre back no matter how good he is. At least we know Mcguire can play in the prem, and very well as well. He is really comfortable on the ball and Pep is gonna make him even better!

The crazy rumors of him going to Juve that so many so called “Tier 1” italian journalists got wrong is probably him or Juve laying the groundwork and planting the seed for his eventual arrival, the same way Pep was rumored heavily in Pelligrini’s last season.

The arrival of Sarri to implement a similar style of play to Pep’s and to ease the transition from Allegri’s more rigid style, the same way Pelligrini was seen as a good transition to Pep from Mancini.

The future squad planning. This ones a bit of a reach but Pep was heavily rumored to have chosen Sterling, KDB and Sane while still being Bayern manager. The acquisition of De Ligt could be seen in a similar light and maybe could’ve been the deciding factor for him to join Juve ahead of Barca and co.

Now I couldn’t care less where Pep goes after he leaves us, he’s been absolutely brilliant for us and has took us to new heights I doubt we’ll see again in my lifetime, but if it does turn out that he’s planning for Juve while still being with us would that sour anyone’s opinion of him?",MCFC

|||||

|Totals|£1,391,050,000|£434,850,000|-£956,200,000|


An average net spend of £88m over the last 11 seasons. I personally HATE net spend. Its for stupid people to use when in reality it ignores so many other pieces of how tranfers are worked on the books. In reality transfers account for a few things:

1) Length of contract

2) Transfer fee

3) Wages

4) Contract Expiry/Transfer Income when said player leaves

Thats how a transfer should be calculated. Looking at transfer at facevalue can be quite silly. To give an example of David Silva who lets say for this argument has been on £200k a week for the entire time he has been here. With a fee off £25m + 9 years at the club + 1 more. David Silva would have served 10 years. Thus his transfer fee on the actual books per accounting terms is 25/10 = a measly £2.5m per year due to amortisation. With 200k a week at £9.6m per year wages David Silva costs Manchester City on the books at £9.6m + £2.5m =£12.1m per year. This is one of the reasons City like to extend contracts early in their life so they can further spread the transfer fee over the life of the contract. So in reality the transfer fee of £2.5m per year starts of bigger and gets smaller of time. Its probably closer to £1-2m depending on when his extensions were signed. Gundogan for example who only has 1 year left on his contract per transfer fee amortisation we would have mostly paid off his transfer fee on the books and are almost only at wages. 

Hope thats not confusing!

The first 3 seasons of our spending in the Mansour era basically went unaccounted for. The owner was basically dumping money into the club left right and centre. A big chunk of our initial spend lies there with us spending a whopping **£483,450,000** in those first 3 seasons. This is what I call the ""catch up"" phase. There is no doubt in my mind that Manchester City squad was wayyy behind the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, and Arsenal. So we essentially had to spend a lot to catch up if we wanted to compete with the big clubs. This is the only time you could actually say City were ""ruining football"" and thats purely because the fees at the time were high and we had to spend over the odds to go quick. Though by the 11/12 season we had AGUERRROOOOOd our first PL title.  So fuck it!

## [](#icon-news-big) **FFP implications** 

Manchester City first started to get implications of potential FFP implications around 2011 to 2013 with an eventual fine and squad limitation in 2014. These same issues are cropping up again from the same time period - our books are good in the present but we might again get punished for wrong doings in 2014 (Can I get a fuck UEFA?). This is why in the seasons between 11/12 to 14/15 season we only had a net spend of £180m over 4 years. This is what Khaldoon described as a pinch that effectively slowed City down because they had to get legitimate streams of revenue to do any further club improvement as per the rules City were no longer allowed to get money from Mansour direclty anymore. 

So we effectively have had to do 2 catch up periods due to FFP. We caught up in 11/12 then stagnated back down. Although we won the PL in 2014 just take a look at the 3 seasons afterwards where we only 1 trophy during that period (league cup in 2016, can i get a fuck Liverpool?) as our squad was aging/not good enough. 


##  [](#icon-notes-big) **New TV money + commercial revenue hugely increased**


After that period we finally were able to freely spend again and with the coming of Pep Guardiola it was time to invest wisely in the squad and get back to the top. In the last 4 seasons we have spent a massive **£662,900,000** or a netspend of **£426,250,000**. A lot of opposing fans will tell you that we must be cheating or the owner is dropping money to do this. 

A netspend of £426,250,000 over 4 years is really not that much with the amount of revenue that comes in. The good thing about City is that the owners DO NOT take money out of the club at all. Every ounce it makes stays within the club. We also have 0 debt. In comparison take a look at what [Uniteds](https://i.redd.it/b4hxwon8ud531.jpg) owners are doing and yet are still able to have a netspend of around £300m in the same time period. 

## [](#icon-notes-big) **Looking at Individual Players** 

I have seen a lot of opposing fans like to claim that Citys buys have always been poor and they just go out and spend another 100m to fix the issue. 

Till this day our record Transfer fee is Riyad Mahrez at £60m 

In the Mansour era we have probably bought around 70-100 players into the first team and obviously most have left or been sold in that time frame. We have also bought a lot of youth who we are starting to see fees coming back from. 

### The bad and TBDs Over the last 11 years 

Suprisingly we havent done too many blunders in our years of spending. You can never nail every transfers for sure but I was acutally suprised how few we have got wrong since the takeover. 

|Players|Buy Fee|Rating|Sold Fee|Money Lost|Season @ City|On Loan|Fee Spread|
:--|--:|:--|--:|--:|:--|:--|--:|
|Benjamin Mendy|£52,000,000|TBD||TBA|2|0|£26,000,000|

|Wilfried Bony|£28,000,000|Bad|£12,000,000|-£16,000,000|3|2|£5,333,333|
|Stevan Jovetic|£25,800,000|Bad|£14,750,000|-£11,050,000|4|2|£2,762,500|
|Emmanuel Adebayor|£25,000,000|Bad|£5,000,000|-£20,000,000|4|3|£5,000,000|
|Jo|£18,000,000|Bad|£0|-£18,000,000|3|2|£6,000,000|
|Roque Santa Cruz|£17,500,000|Bad|£1,000,000|-£16,500,000|5|3|£3,300,000|
|Claudio Bravo|£17,100,000|Bad||TBA|3|0|£5,700,000|
|Javi Garcia|£16,000,000|Bad|£13,000,000|-£3,000,000|2|0|£1,500,000|
|Jack Rodwell|£15,000,000|Bad|£10,000,000|-£5,000,000|2|1|£2,500,000|
|Nolito|£13,800,000|Bad|£7,900,000|-£5,900,000|1|0|£5,900,000|
|Patrick Roberts|£11,000,000|Bad||TBA|4|4|£2,750,000|
|Scott Sinclair|£8,000,000|Bad|£3,500,000|-£4,500,000|3|2|£1,500,000|
|Totals|£311,700,000||£94,150,000|£137,450,000|||£79,895,833|


So over 11 years of transfers we have essentially lost £137m to bad transfers. With a lot of those contracts majority spending it out on loan so on the books we probably werent paying their wages but only the bad transfer fee.  (I made up the mangala sell fee of £5m because having that not count here is really bad lol)

The fee spread is a good way to visualise how much it roughly cost us per season on the books. 


Nothings hits me more than when opposing fans say we just buy any and every play at 40-50m and if they dont work we just buy another. Looking at this we have only had a few poor transfers in the last few seasons. Everything else was almost 5 seasons ago.

## [](#icon-ball)[](#icon-net) **Some stats:**


- In the 11 years since the take over Manchester City have spent  £30m or more a total of only 15 times

- Over £40m a total of 8 times

- Over £50m a total of 4 times

- Over £60m a **grand total of 0 fucken times**

- Of players at or over £30m they have been demed good transfers 13 out of 15 times. Take out Mendy and itll go down to 12 out of 15 times. Thats a success rate of 87% -  pretty good if you ask me. 


With this youll see the club is in immaculately healthy position players and fee wise. 


So when opposing fans tell you Manchester City are ruining football. Tell them kindly to fuck off lol. 

Final note: Rodriguez is about to ruin my over £60m transfer fee due to his €70m release clause which due to current conversion rates becomes £62.1m (BOOOOO!!!) - Fuck it though he is going to be amazing and is only 22 years old. 5 years in when he is hitting his peak that fee will look tiny when Clubs will be paying £100m for Delph like players.",MCFC

2132,Rodri stats compared to Fernandinho and Busquets,"Since yesterday I am hyped for Rodri and can't wait for him to sign for us. I was checking how well he would be suited to City and his stats say it all. I compared his 18/19 season with 17/18 Fernandinho and 15/16 Busquets. I believe 17/18 and 15/16 were the best seasons for Ferna and Busquets respectively. This is what I found

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Stat|Rodri (18/19)|Fernandinho(17/18)|Busquets(15/16)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|*Minutes*| 2743 | 2885 | **2906** |
|*Tackles per game*| **3** |1.8|2.9|

| *Clearances per game* | **2** |1.9|0.7|

| *Bad control per game* |0.6|1| **0.4** |
| *Passes per game* |56.7| **87.5** |69.2|
| *Pass success percentage* | **91.1** |90.1|89.8|
|Avg Rating (Whoscored)|7.24| **7.44** |7.28|

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From the above stats it is pretty evident that Rodri is defensively almost par with prime Fernandinho and Busquets whereas has scope for improvement offensively. Being 22 and with Pep as his coach, I am pretty confident he can only improve and will become one of the best DMs to have ever played. 

&amp;#x200B;

The standout stat for me is Bad control per game. I thought Fernandinho almost never had a bad touch and Rodri's stat is better than Ferna.",MCFC

Sounding optimistic we could have at least one in next week.

I would expect it to be Rodri.

Don't count out de Ligt just yet. The player has asked again about Pep and City.

There are hurdles (some are more obvious than others)

He's feeling the pressure a little in terms of all the interest. Worryingly, Liverpool have also started some sort of charm offensive.

Maguire is considered at least £20m too expensive and doesn't represent the value we want from making City's next centre half the most expensive in the world.

Mino certainly has food for thought.

If Leroy goes, Felix comes. Zinchenko and Walker new deals to be announced when they return.

Muric wanted on loan by two Premier League clubs.

Don't think Otamendi is leaving as things stand, maybe Vinny going has changed that.

No real update on Leroy. Bravo staying for final year.

2196,Do you think we should loan out Foden next year?,"I think he’s an exceptional young talent and has a real future at the club, but he’s not a first team regular - which he would be anywhere below 6th place in the prem.

I remember players like Ramsey, Wilshire and Kane going out on loan to get regular first team and coming back stronger for it. 

With El Mago aged 33 and Fernandinho at 34 but still exceptional would you rather he was brought in as they get phased out, or keep the phenomenal talent they have regularly in the team and giving him the opportunity to be a premier league regular elsewhere?

Bear in mind he only played 90 mins in 3 premier league matches last year despite De Bruyne’s injury, I just wondered what everyone’s thoughts were.",MCFC

Never been to the UK before, but I'm going to be there in August. Looking to take the train up from London and get tickets to the Tottenham game on Sat August 17 if possible. Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I can understand, my best chance of getting a ticket is signing up as a Cityzen? 
If I'm not signed up as a Cityzen do I have any chance at getting tickets for this game? How long before the match do tickets typically go on sale online for Cityzens and/or General sale? Just looking for any advice you guys can give me about getting tickets as I don't really know how it works and what the demand is like (I assume it will be pretty high for this game as its the first home game of the season and its Tottenham).

Thanks for your advice :)",MCFC

2239,Will there be an announcement?,"Pep will see out two years with City, that I am sure (the man said it himself!).

However, I find very few people stating the obvious:

Given the credible nature of some of these sources, what may be the case is Pep has already signed a forward contract with Juve that’s now sitting in a safe somewhere. What those terms and conditions are, we may never know. What we do know is this is exactly how it happened when Pep joined City from Bayern. Pep had already starting advising City on potential targets as early as a year before he joined. Starling the most famous one. 

Also, most people don’t remember this, but Bayern fans were shocked and left bitter Pep was leaving. Some players even admitted they were caught unaware. Especially after culling a CL /WC winning squad and never delivering the CL himself. Regardless of the trophies he brings in the coming 2 years, I doubt Pep will want to repeat anything like that again. When he says he is here for another 2 years, I believe him. But I don’t think he wants us to read too much into it beyond that. 

City is bigger than one man. Our competitive advantage comes from us being a well oiled machine. And that means being good at smoothing out transitions. I think that’s exactly what’s happening here.

Since I cant figure out how to respond (God I hate Reddit) If you think this is the only present im getting her you are sorely mistaken, I dont do cheap its all in or not at all.

This is also supported by numbers that city is profittable lsat 4 years. The club value is estimated at 2.2 bn while he says the investment (total) is around 1.3 bn.

&amp;#x200B;

Kun Notes:

\- It's Kun...there's not a lot that you guys aren't well aware of.

\- Insanely consistent bagging 33, 30, then 32 goals. Minute totals of 3500, 2900, and 3400.

\- The threat of GJ was exactly what he needed.

\- Personal opinion for next season is that he plays slightly less minutes and hopefully puts up 34-40 goals as we start bedding in GJ. He could easily get 40+ rotation is obviously key.

&amp;#x200B;

Gabriel Jesus Notes:

\- Embracing the role of deputy with great morale which had to be difficult considering he was first choice not long after coming in on fire and especially with those two injuries.

\- Has a lot of work to do timing his runs and will get better as a finisher. We're blessed with Kun so I think that diminishes Gabby to a degree. The fact of the matter is that he scores goals when he plays and the squad doesn't significantly drop off either.

\- Constantly coming in as a SUB and without a long run of starts weakens his numbers but as a number 2 and potential long term replacement he's been perfect for us these past 2 and a half seasons and I'm not sure that we win two league cups and the FA without him.

\- There's been chatter over the years about fans not being sure if he can lead the line with Kun out and I'm 100% convinced that's bogus. There's also been chatter about not trust him for the big games and that also is 100% bogus. I ran the PL data on games he started / played over 45 minutes and it came back with a 30-4-1 record which is on pace for 102 points. I also ran though those games looking for matches vs top teams and he's excelled every time he's been given the chance. He's started Spurs away, Chelsea away, and vs LFC. We won all 3, he scored 3 and assisted 1. Obviously there was the cup final where he scored 2 and assisted 1 as well.

\- He's not ready yet but I hope he gets more chances in bigger games.

\- Personal Opinion for next season is that he gets close to 2800 minutes and threatens 30 goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Kelechi Notes:

\- Super bummed that it's not working out for him because he always seemed to get the job done when he was called upon. Obviously he had to leave but thanks Kelechi for missing that easy goal vs us!",MCFC

2363,Man Utd and Man City make moves for Joao Felix in £120m battle with Real Madrid,"Manchester United and City are embroiled in a £120million tug of war with Real Madrid for Portugal whizkid Joao Felix.

Both Premier League clubs will have scouts watching Benfica teenager Felix in Portugal’s Nations League semi-final against Switzerland in Porto on Wednesday night.

United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has targeted Portugal’s latest footballing sensation as he begins the rebuilding of his team after a disappointing season.

But he faces fierce competition from Real, who are desperate to land the Benfica teenager, City and also Italian giants Juventus.

Benfica want around £120million and Real have already seen an opening bid of around £80m rejected.

But they are now expected to use Benfica’s interest in goalkeeper Keylor Navas to try to clinch a deal next week after the finals.

Felix, 19, scored 18 goals in 33 games for Benfica this season and became the youngest player to score a Europa League hat trick since Sergio Aguero when he netted three against Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter finals in April.

The teenager is set to make his senior debut for Portugal against the Swiss in Porto, after being called up for the finals by coach Fernando Santos

For the uninitiated, numerous very reliable Italian journalists, including the guy that same CR7 would go to Juventus, have stated that it is certain Pep Guardiola will be announced as Juventus manager on 4th June, with an official unveiling on 14th June. Join us for all the build up to this defining moment of the summer.

All we've had from City's side so far is unreliable guys like a board member and Pep Guardiola denying the claims, so without any credible sources, we can only assume that this is going ahead.

2367,Mendy needs to be replaced or scared into reality,"Benjamin Mendy has only made 17 league appearances in his 2 years on the blue side of Manchester compared to his 1 year in ligue 1 with monoco where he made 8 more appearances with 25. In my opinion he is a liability and Pep Guardiola should highly consider out right replacing him or buying another left-back to put some fear in mendy. I could easily make the argument that with a healthy mendy the title race would've been a lot smoother and maybe we would be talking about champions league glory with that bum rushing, good crossing, and powerful option at left-back. Instead we had an out of position zinchenko at left-back which I must say he did a job but he wasn't mindblowing. It has been said Guardiola will be giving him another chance which I could get behind as long as we go out and buy someone to give him a run for his money. I would be very happy with buying a chilwell or a Tierney from Celtic this would get Mendy off of the social media and focusing on his fitness and his place in the squad. Also we must say the Premier league is a way more physical league then the French league he has already shown to be injury prone so we must get another recruit for that side of the back line. Just to finish this off I should let you know I am a fan of mendy and his abilities he obviously is a world class left back but if we want to continue our dominance in England and progressing in Europe I believe this is a problem position based on Benjamin's attitude and fitness. Anyone agree?",MCFC

Hoeness told the German press (Kicker) that it's about insane price-tags. Hence he does not see the move happening.

In the same time, Rashford was inform those couple months and  what I was seeing from a variety of twitter and football discussion sites was that Rashford was having a much better season then jesus and is better than Jesus. 

I looked at the stats...

Rashford scored 10 goals in 26 starts (one every 243 minutes) while Jesus was 7 in 8 (1 every 146 minutes) in the PL.

Rashford scored 2 goals in 8 starts (1 every 364 minutes) while Jesus was 4 in 4 (1 every 93.75 minutes) in the CL.

2398,Man City identify three midfield summer transfer targets,"Source : Sky Sports


Manchester City are monitoring three midfielders as they continue their pursuit of a replacement for Fernandinho.

According to Manchester evening news, Atletico Madrid midfielder Rodri remains City's No.1 target but the Blues are not pinning all of their hopes on landing the 22-year-old.

Rodri has a release clause of €70million at Atletico but City are hopeful of signing him for a lower fee.

Should that not be possible City may look elsewhere, with Lyon's Tanguy Ndombele and Real Madrid's Marco Llorente both on the Blues' radar.
Ndombele shone for Lyon in their Champions League win at the Etihad at the beginning of the campaign.

Lyon reportedly rejected a bid from Tottenham for the 22-year-old midfielder earlier this week.

Llorente, meanwhile, endured an injury-ravaged campaign at Madrid and managed just 16 appearances in all competitions.

City are determined to sign Fernandinho's long-term successor this summer after losing out to Chelsea in their pursuit of Jorginho last year.
It had looked for all the world like the Italy international would move to the Etihad only for the lure of moving to London and working with Maurizio Sarri to turn his head at the 11th hour.

Fernandinho turns 35 next season and injury forced him to miss almost a quarter of City's Premier League games over the course of their title-winning campaign.

The Germany international Ilkay Gundogan proved himself to be an able deputy for Fernandinho in the run-in but there are doubts surrounding his long-term future at the club, despite his insistence that he is keen to renew his contract in Manchester.",MCFC

Manchester United are reportedly looking to beat rivals City to the signature of Sporting Lisbon midfielder Bruno Fernandes.

The 24-year-old scored 32 goals and contributed 18 assists in 53 matches last season and as a result has attracted interest from European clubs.

United are eyeing a move for Fernandes and are set to challenge Premier League champions City, according to Portuguese outlet A Bola.

The newspaper's front page on Friday, translated in English, read: 'Man United come ahead.

'Proposal of City does not convince and rival of Manchester will attack Bruno Fernandes.'

Only player I can think of is Kai Havertz, the kid looks something special and would be over 100m, there is obviously Mbappe but i think he has too big an ego for us lot. This has got me thinking because Joao Felix being labelled over 100m is shocking and I would be dissappointed if we pay that.

If we're getting winger, then we we're looking at a ridiculously expensive joao felix. I don't know how i feel about potentially paying more for felix than we're getting for sane. 

If we're getting a MF then there were the talks of bruno earlier that were debunked, as well as whispers tielemans this morning. I would also like to throw Kai Havertz in there.
