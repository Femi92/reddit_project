6,less month opening day united done fix last seasons problems,intro apologies wall text skip conclusion tl dr watched last season likely agree exception weeks solskjaer honeymoon period disaster difficult imagine quite could worse contrast fairly simple identify reasons bad quite apply entire post saf period focusing last season listed basic problems many tie one another go done rectify 1 toxic manager 2 incompetent planning player recruitment strategy 3 enough quality centre back 4 right sided width 5 aging first team right backs 6 aging defensive midfielders 7 general lack work rate fitness 8 wage structure ongoing contract negotiations 9 problem players feel free add problems see comment done 1 toxic manager mourinho obviously poisonous presence club toward end tenure imo made position untenable go one particular memory always reign west ham away game late september mourinho started scott mctominay central defence view fairly blatant act petulant vindictive defiance given bailly darmian bench day big childish middle finger ed woodward direction quickly went behind game lost 3 1 competed something see time last season extent made mark noble look like prime edgar davids clear though mourinho never really main problem changed change obviously sacked brought solskjaer great honeymoon period however weeks hopeful promise better times ahead replaced realisation nothing significance changed ole seemed fairly quickly abandon initial positive style play pragmatic mourinho approach began graso strengths weaknesses fitness levels later team inherited finished season pretty abysmal form 2 incompetent planning player recruitment strategy course ties problem 1 much reason mourinho toxicity born lack respect backing shown board particular ed woodward plain see fit run sporting side club give mourinho contract extension months later refuse sign targets really surprise offered spiteful team selections depressing press conferences changed change well nothing far seems little hope anything changing front summer hear rumours club looking appoint experienced sporting director rumours soon became whispers ex players rio ferdinand darren fletcher considered job faded away entirely continue woodward making signings signing daniel james another lw crying rw fairly typical recent transfer strategy although vacuum looks like good value signing hopefully suggestive plans move along high paid performing lws near future 3 enough quality centre back mourinho identified centre back problem fair anyone watching us could identify centre back problem previously brought bailly lindelof though much input signings debatable discarded bailly showed raw risky player showed almost much distrust lindelof shaky start united lindelof settled much better looks decent signing need better area mourinho wanted alderweireld board clearly said toby would expensive short sighted matic like signing would surely made us better changed change nothing far summer get used reading even solid rumour anything area priority month right 4 right sided width fine favour one side pitch attack reliable threat right number seasons mainly used lingard mata neither offer actual width side look drift inside without ball makes us predictable thus easier defend changed change nothing really maybe awb signing later allows us use dalot right winger convinced see better results right side season heard basically rumours signings area 5 aging first team right backs young started last year quite poorly rb still seemed fade put frankly embarrassing performances toward end season valencia darmian basically non factors dalot bought last year raw prospect rather finished article changed change well allowed valencia leave splashed awb good signing potential great one though sure solves immediate lack right sided attacking width looks far accomplished defence attack least signed someone first team finally 6 aging defensive midfielders mourinho signing matic ok typically short sighted one matic followed good first season worst premier league campaign helped injury functional squad player club united stature seems decline herrera two good seasons five years united 2014 15 2016 17 odd ed allowed signing alderweireld changed change nothing helpful far failed offer herrera sort contract holding ligue 1 imo worth money getting psg although blow dressing room blow pitch provided sign decent defensively minded midfielder matic books next season option year suggest take needed younger reinforcements herrera departure certainly gone mario lemina would solid unspectacular replacement herrera going need replacement matic well 7 general lack work rate fitness third laziest team premier league last year behind west ham cardiff clubs seriously competing top 9 distance covered totally unacceptable mourinho complained last year pre season preparations disrupted world cup teams problem dealt better head coach surely take blame changed change remains seen united must simply must work harder next year must prepare correctly next month one problem real hope expectation sorted 8 wage structure ongoing contract negotiations really really shit bed signed sanchez awful since joining bloated contract torn semblance wage structure unsettled several players guys like de gea rightfully thinking sanchez worth 350k p w changed change well rashford got 5 years 200k p w lot 21 year old much prove reference money de gea currently valuable club home grown player hopefully builds last year makes contract look like bargain gonna decide de gea uncertainty future must surely played role probably worst full premier league season pay world class keeper likely yet entered prime ultimately settle things need get rid sanchez though likely necessitate paying play elsewhere 9 problem players mainly referring pogba lukaku could include others like martial hearts appear learnt anything saf years player bigger club need identify players want need resolve get rid beckham stam van nistelrooy keane etc etc lots great players shown door undermining disrespecting club losing focus changed change nothing yet without even vaguely acceptable bid yet keeping players patently unhappy club solskjaer taken page saf playbook tried deflect attention blame back toward media players literally quoted angling moves pretty transparent damage control exercise acceptable bid comes pogba lukaku sell reinvest conclusion tl dr thus far done little solve real problems disappointed woodward still charge transfers still done virtually nothing address squad weaknesses less month left till start 2019 20 season stands little cause hope foresee another depressing season spent struggling consistent form vying top 4 finish problems club systemic change needed almost top bottom realistically board hires actual experienced technical director dof continue see total lack direction transfer market continue see managers fired real problems heads,0

240,less month opening day united done fix last seasons problems,intro apologies wall text skip conclusion tl dr watched last season likely agree exception weeks solskjaer honeymoon period disaster difficult imagine quite could worse contrast fairly simple identify reasons bad quite apply entire post saf period focusing last season listed basic problems many tie one another go done rectify 1 toxic manager 2 incompetent planning player recruitment strategy 3 enough quality centre back 4 right sided width 5 aging first team right backs 6 aging defensive midfielders 7 general lack work rate fitness 8 wage structure ongoing contract negotiations 9 problem players feel free add problems see comment done 1 toxic manager mourinho obviously poisonous presence club toward end tenure imo made position untenable go one particular memory always reign west ham away game late september mourinho started scott mctominay central defence view fairly blatant act petulant vindictive defiance given bailly darmian bench day big childish middle finger ed woodward direction quickly went behind game lost 3 1 competed something see time last season extent made mark noble look like prime edgar davids clear though mourinho never really main problem changed change obviously sacked brought solskjaer great honeymoon period however weeks hopeful promise better times ahead replaced realisation nothing significance changed ole seemed fairly quickly abandon initial positive style play pragmatic mourinho approach began graso strengths weaknesses fitness levels later team inherited finished season pretty abysmal form 2 incompetent planning player recruitment strategy course ties problem 1 much reason mourinho toxicity born lack respect backing shown board particular ed woodward plain see fit run sporting side club give mourinho contract extension months later refuse sign targets really surprise offered spiteful team selections depressing press conferences changed change well nothing far seems little hope anything changing front summer hear rumours club looking appoint experienced sporting director rumours soon became whispers ex players rio ferdinand darren fletcher considered job faded away entirely continue woodward making signings signing daniel james another lw crying rw fairly typical recent transfer strategy although vacuum looks like good value signing hopefully suggestive plans move along high paid performing lws near future 3 enough quality centre back mourinho identified centre back problem fair anyone watching us could identify centre back problem previously brought bailly lindelof though much input signings debatable discarded bailly showed raw risky player showed almost much distrust lindelof shaky start united lindelof settled much better looks decent signing need better area mourinho wanted alderweireld board clearly said toby would expensive short sighted matic like signing would surely made us better changed change nothing far summer get used reading even solid rumour anything area priority month right 4 right sided width fine favour one side pitch attack reliable threat right number seasons mainly used lingard mata neither offer actual width side look drift inside without ball makes us predictable thus easier defend changed change nothing really maybe awb signing later allows us use dalot right winger convinced see better results right side season heard basically rumours signings area 5 aging first team right backs young started last year quite poorly rb still seemed fade put frankly embarrassing performances toward end season valencia darmian basically non factors dalot bought last year raw prospect rather finished article changed change well allowed valencia leave splashed awb good signing potential great one though sure solves immediate lack right sided attacking width looks far accomplished defence attack least signed someone first team finally 6 aging defensive midfielders mourinho signing matic ok typically short sighted one matic followed good first season worst premier league campaign helped injury functional squad player club united stature seems decline herrera two good seasons five years united 2014 15 2016 17 odd ed allowed signing alderweireld changed change nothing helpful far failed offer herrera sort contract holding ligue 1 imo worth money getting psg although blow dressing room blow pitch provided sign decent defensively minded midfielder matic books next season option year suggest take needed younger reinforcements herrera departure certainly gone mario lemina would solid unspectacular replacement herrera going need replacement matic well 7 general lack work rate fitness third laziest team premier league last year behind west ham cardiff clubs seriously competing top 9 distance covered totally unacceptable mourinho complained last year pre season preparations disrupted world cup teams problem dealt better head coach surely take blame changed change remains seen united must simply must work harder next year must prepare correctly next month one problem real hope expectation sorted 8 wage structure ongoing contract negotiations really really shit bed signed sanchez awful since joining bloated contract torn semblance wage structure unsettled several players guys like de gea rightfully thinking sanchez worth 350k p w changed change well rashford got 5 years 200k p w lot 21 year old much prove reference money de gea currently valuable club home grown player hopefully builds last year makes contract look like bargain gonna decide de gea uncertainty future must surely played role probably worst full premier league season pay world class keeper likely yet entered prime ultimately settle things need get rid sanchez though likely necessitate paying play elsewhere 9 problem players mainly referring pogba lukaku could include others like martial hearts appear learnt anything saf years player bigger club need identify players want need resolve get rid beckham stam van nistelrooy keane etc etc lots great players shown door undermining disrespecting club losing focus changed change nothing yet without even vaguely acceptable bid yet keeping players patently unhappy club solskjaer taken page saf playbook tried deflect attention blame back toward media players literally quoted angling moves pretty transparent damage control exercise acceptable bid comes pogba lukaku sell reinvest conclusion tl dr thus far done little solve real problems disappointed woodward still charge transfers still done virtually nothing address squad weaknesses less month left till start 2019 20 season stands little cause hope foresee another depressing season spent struggling consistent form vying top 4 finish problems club systemic change needed almost top bottom realistically board hires actual experienced technical director dof continue see total lack direction transfer market continue see managers fired real problems heads,0

474,less month opening day united done fix last seasons problems,intro apologies wall text skip conclusion tl dr watched last season likely agree exception weeks solskjaer honeymoon period disaster difficult imagine quite could worse contrast fairly simple identify reasons bad quite apply entire post saf period focusing last season listed basic problems many tie one another go done rectify 1 toxic manager 2 incompetent planning player recruitment strategy 3 enough quality centre back 4 right sided width 5 aging first team right backs 6 aging defensive midfielders 7 general lack work rate fitness 8 wage structure ongoing contract negotiations 9 problem players feel free add problems see comment done 1 toxic manager mourinho obviously poisonous presence club toward end tenure imo made position untenable go one particular memory always reign west ham away game late september mourinho started scott mctominay central defence view fairly blatant act petulant vindictive defiance given bailly darmian bench day big childish middle finger ed woodward direction quickly went behind game lost 3 1 competed something see time last season extent made mark noble look like prime edgar davids clear though mourinho never really main problem changed change obviously sacked brought solskjaer great honeymoon period however weeks hopeful promise better times ahead replaced realisation nothing significance changed ole seemed fairly quickly abandon initial positive style play pragmatic mourinho approach began graso strengths weaknesses fitness levels later team inherited finished season pretty abysmal form 2 incompetent planning player recruitment strategy course ties problem 1 much reason mourinho toxicity born lack respect backing shown board particular ed woodward plain see fit run sporting side club give mourinho contract extension months later refuse sign targets really surprise offered spiteful team selections depressing press conferences changed change well nothing far seems little hope anything changing front summer hear rumours club looking appoint experienced sporting director rumours soon became whispers ex players rio ferdinand darren fletcher considered job faded away entirely continue woodward making signings signing daniel james another lw crying rw fairly typical recent transfer strategy although vacuum looks like good value signing hopefully suggestive plans move along high paid performing lws near future 3 enough quality centre back mourinho identified centre back problem fair anyone watching us could identify centre back problem previously brought bailly lindelof though much input signings debatable discarded bailly showed raw risky player showed almost much distrust lindelof shaky start united lindelof settled much better looks decent signing need better area mourinho wanted alderweireld board clearly said toby would expensive short sighted matic like signing would surely made us better changed change nothing far summer get used reading even solid rumour anything area priority month right 4 right sided width fine favour one side pitch attack reliable threat right number seasons mainly used lingard mata neither offer actual width side look drift inside without ball makes us predictable thus easier defend changed change nothing really maybe awb signing later allows us use dalot right winger convinced see better results right side season heard basically rumours signings area 5 aging first team right backs young started last year quite poorly rb still seemed fade put frankly embarrassing performances toward end season valencia darmian basically non factors dalot bought last year raw prospect rather finished article changed change well allowed valencia leave splashed awb good signing potential great one though sure solves immediate lack right sided attacking width looks far accomplished defence attack least signed someone first team finally 6 aging defensive midfielders mourinho signing matic ok typically short sighted one matic followed good first season worst premier league campaign helped injury functional squad player club united stature seems decline herrera two good seasons five years united 2014 15 2016 17 odd ed allowed signing alderweireld changed change nothing helpful far failed offer herrera sort contract holding ligue 1 imo worth money getting psg although blow dressing room blow pitch provided sign decent defensively minded midfielder matic books next season option year suggest take needed younger reinforcements herrera departure certainly gone mario lemina would solid unspectacular replacement herrera going need replacement matic well 7 general lack work rate fitness third laziest team premier league last year behind west ham cardiff clubs seriously competing top 9 distance covered totally unacceptable mourinho complained last year pre season preparations disrupted world cup teams problem dealt better head coach surely take blame changed change remains seen united must simply must work harder next year must prepare correctly next month one problem real hope expectation sorted 8 wage structure ongoing contract negotiations really really shit bed signed sanchez awful since joining bloated contract torn semblance wage structure unsettled several players guys like de gea rightfully thinking sanchez worth 350k p w changed change well rashford got 5 years 200k p w lot 21 year old much prove reference money de gea currently valuable club home grown player hopefully builds last year makes contract look like bargain gonna decide de gea uncertainty future must surely played role probably worst full premier league season pay world class keeper likely yet entered prime ultimately settle things need get rid sanchez though likely necessitate paying play elsewhere 9 problem players mainly referring pogba lukaku could include others like martial hearts appear learnt anything saf years player bigger club need identify players want need resolve get rid beckham stam van nistelrooy keane etc etc lots great players shown door undermining disrespecting club losing focus changed change nothing yet without even vaguely acceptable bid yet keeping players patently unhappy club solskjaer taken page saf playbook tried deflect attention blame back toward media players literally quoted angling moves pretty transparent damage control exercise acceptable bid comes pogba lukaku sell reinvest conclusion tl dr thus far done little solve real problems disappointed woodward still charge transfers still done virtually nothing address squad weaknesses less month left till start 2019 20 season stands little cause hope foresee another depressing season spent struggling consistent form vying top 4 finish problems club systemic change needed almost top bottom realistically board hires actual experienced technical director dof continue see total lack direction transfer market continue see managers fired real problems heads,0

708,less month opening day united done fix last seasons problems,intro apologies wall text skip conclusion tl dr watched last season likely agree exception weeks solskjaer honeymoon period disaster difficult imagine quite could worse contrast fairly simple identify reasons bad quite apply entire post saf period focusing last season listed basic problems many tie one another go done rectify 1 toxic manager 2 incompetent planning player recruitment strategy 3 enough quality centre back 4 right sided width 5 aging first team right backs 6 aging defensive midfielders 7 general lack work rate fitness 8 wage structure ongoing contract negotiations 9 problem players feel free add problems see comment done 1 toxic manager mourinho obviously poisonous presence club toward end tenure imo made position untenable go one particular memory always reign west ham away game late september mourinho started scott mctominay central defence view fairly blatant act petulant vindictive defiance given bailly darmian bench day big childish middle finger ed woodward direction quickly went behind game lost 3 1 competed something see time last season extent made mark noble look like prime edgar davids clear though mourinho never really main problem changed change obviously sacked brought solskjaer great honeymoon period however weeks hopeful promise better times ahead replaced realisation nothing significance changed ole seemed fairly quickly abandon initial positive style play pragmatic mourinho approach began graso strengths weaknesses fitness levels later team inherited finished season pretty abysmal form 2 incompetent planning player recruitment strategy course ties problem 1 much reason mourinho toxicity born lack respect backing shown board particular ed woodward plain see fit run sporting side club give mourinho contract extension months later refuse sign targets really surprise offered spiteful team selections depressing press conferences changed change well nothing far seems little hope anything changing front summer hear rumours club looking appoint experienced sporting director rumours soon became whispers ex players rio ferdinand darren fletcher considered job faded away entirely continue woodward making signings signing daniel james another lw crying rw fairly typical recent transfer strategy although vacuum looks like good value signing hopefully suggestive plans move along high paid performing lws near future 3 enough quality centre back mourinho identified centre back problem fair anyone watching us could identify centre back problem previously brought bailly lindelof though much input signings debatable discarded bailly showed raw risky player showed almost much distrust lindelof shaky start united lindelof settled much better looks decent signing need better area mourinho wanted alderweireld board clearly said toby would expensive short sighted matic like signing would surely made us better changed change nothing far summer get used reading even solid rumour anything area priority month right 4 right sided width fine favour one side pitch attack reliable threat right number seasons mainly used lingard mata neither offer actual width side look drift inside without ball makes us predictable thus easier defend changed change nothing really maybe awb signing later allows us use dalot right winger convinced see better results right side season heard basically rumours signings area 5 aging first team right backs young started last year quite poorly rb still seemed fade put frankly embarrassing performances toward end season valencia darmian basically non factors dalot bought last year raw prospect rather finished article changed change well allowed valencia leave splashed awb good signing potential great one though sure solves immediate lack right sided attacking width looks far accomplished defence attack least signed someone first team finally 6 aging defensive midfielders mourinho signing matic ok typically short sighted one matic followed good first season worst premier league campaign helped injury functional squad player club united stature seems decline herrera two good seasons five years united 2014 15 2016 17 odd ed allowed signing alderweireld changed change nothing helpful far failed offer herrera sort contract holding ligue 1 imo worth money getting psg although blow dressing room blow pitch provided sign decent defensively minded midfielder matic books next season option year suggest take needed younger reinforcements herrera departure certainly gone mario lemina would solid unspectacular replacement herrera going need replacement matic well 7 general lack work rate fitness third laziest team premier league last year behind west ham cardiff clubs seriously competing top 9 distance covered totally unacceptable mourinho complained last year pre season preparations disrupted world cup teams problem dealt better head coach surely take blame changed change remains seen united must simply must work harder next year must prepare correctly next month one problem real hope expectation sorted 8 wage structure ongoing contract negotiations really really shit bed signed sanchez awful since joining bloated contract torn semblance wage structure unsettled several players guys like de gea rightfully thinking sanchez worth 350k p w changed change well rashford got 5 years 200k p w lot 21 year old much prove reference money de gea currently valuable club home grown player hopefully builds last year makes contract look like bargain gonna decide de gea uncertainty future must surely played role probably worst full premier league season pay world class keeper likely yet entered prime ultimately settle things need get rid sanchez though likely necessitate paying play elsewhere 9 problem players mainly referring pogba lukaku could include others like martial hearts appear learnt anything saf years player bigger club need identify players want need resolve get rid beckham stam van nistelrooy keane etc etc lots great players shown door undermining disrespecting club losing focus changed change nothing yet without even vaguely acceptable bid yet keeping players patently unhappy club solskjaer taken page saf playbook tried deflect attention blame back toward media players literally quoted angling moves pretty transparent damage control exercise acceptable bid comes pogba lukaku sell reinvest conclusion tl dr thus far done little solve real problems disappointed woodward still charge transfers still done virtually nothing address squad weaknesses less month left till start 2019 20 season stands little cause hope foresee another depressing season spent struggling consistent form vying top 4 finish problems club systemic change needed almost top bottom realistically board hires actual experienced technical director dof continue see total lack direction transfer market continue see managers fired real problems heads,0
