56,56,56,Less than a month until opening day. What have United done to fix last seasons problems?,"##Intro
Apologies for the wall of text. Skip to the conclusion for the TL;DR.

If you watched any of last season you'd likely agree it was (with the exception of the few weeks of Solskjaer's honeymoon period) a disaster. It's difficult to imagine quite where and how it could have been worse. By contrast it's fairly simple to identify some reasons *why* it was so bad. Quite a few of these apply to the entire post-SAF period, but I'll be focusing on last season and this.

I've listed a few basic problems, many of which tie into one another. I'll then go over what has been (and is being) done to rectify them*:

1. Toxic Manager.
2. Incompetent planning/player recruitment strategy.
3. Not enough quality at centre-back.
4. No right-sided width.
5. Aging first team right backs.
6. Aging defensive-midfielders.
7. General lack of work-rate and fitness.
8. Wage-structure and ongoing contract negotiations.
9. Problem players.

^* ^Feel ^free ^to ^add ^other ^problems ^as ^you ^see ^them, ^and ^comment ^about ^what ^is ^being ^done ^about ^them.

##1\. Toxic Manager
Mourinho was obviously a poisonous presence at the club toward the end of his tenure, and IMO he made his position untenable and had to go.

One particular memory I'll always have of his reign is of the West Ham away game in late September. Mourinho started with Scott McTominay in central defence. This was, in my view, a fairly blatant act of petulant, vindictive defiance, given that we had Bailly and Darmian on the bench that day. It was a big, childish middle-finger in Ed Woodward's direction. We quickly went behind in the game, and lost 3-1 having been out-competed (something we'd see time and again last season) to the extent that we made Mark Noble look like prime Edgar Davids.

It's clear, though, that Mourinho was never *really* the main problem.

**What has changed/will change?**

We obviously sacked him and brought in Solskjaer, who had a great honeymoon period. However, after a few weeks the hopeful promise of better times ahead was replaced by the realisation that nothing of significance had changed. Ole seemed to fairly quickly abandon his initial positive style of play for a more pragmatic ""Mourinho"" approach, as he began to graso the strengths, weaknesses, and fitness levels (more on that later) of the team he had inherited. We finished the season in pretty abysmal form.

##2\. Incompetent planning/player recruitment strategy
This of course ties into problem 1, because much of the reason for Mourinho's toxicity was born of a lack of respect and backing shown to him by the board, and in particular Ed Woodward who, it's plain to see, is not fit to run the sporting side of the club. Give Mourinho a contract extension, then a few months later refuse to sign his targets? Is it really a surprise he offered up the spiteful team selections and depressing press conferences that he did?

**What has changed/will change?**

Well...nothing so far, and there seems to be little hope anything will be changing on this front this summer. We did hear rumours that the club was looking to appoint an experienced sporting director, but those rumours soon became whispers that ex-players such as Rio Ferdinand and Darren Fletcher were being considered for the job, then faded away entirely. We continue with Woodward making the signings.

The signing of Daniel James (ANOTHER LW!) when we are crying out for a RW is fairly typical of our recent transfer strategy, although in a vacuum it looks like a good value signing. Hopefully it's suggestive of plans to move along some of our high-paid under-performing LWs in the near future.

##3\. Not enough quality at centre-back
Mourinho identified centre-back as a problem. To be fair, anyone watching us could identify centre-back as a problem. He previously brought in Bailly and Lindelof (though how much input he had in those signings is debatable). He discarded Bailly after he showed himself to be a very raw and risky player, and he showed almost as much distrust in Lindelof after his shaky start at United. Lindelof has settled in much better, and looks a decent signing but we need more and better in this area. Mourinho wanted Alderweireld, but the board clearly said no. Toby would have been an expensive, short-sighted, Matic-like signing, but would surely have made us better.

**What has changed/will change?**

Nothing so far this summer (get used to reading that), with not even a solid rumour of anything in this area. This has to be a priority this month, right?

##4\. No right-sided width
It's fine to favour one side of the pitch when you attack, but we have no reliable threat on the right, and haven't had for some number of seasons now. We mainly used Lingard and Mata there, and neither offer actual width on that side, as they look to drift inside with or without the ball. This makes us very predictable, and thus easier to defend against.

**What has changed/will change?**

Again, nothing really. Maybe the AWB signing (more later) allows us to use Dalot as a right winger? I'm not convinced we'll see any better results from the right side this season, and we've heard basically no rumours of any signings in this area.

##5\. Aging first team right-backs
Young started last year quite poorly at RB, but still seemed to fade, and put in some frankly embarrassing performances toward the end of the season. Valencia and Darmian were basically non-factors. Dalot was bought last year, but is a raw prospect rather than the finished article.

**What has changed/will change?**

Well, we allowed Valencia to leave. And then splashed out on AWB. This is a good signing with the potential to be a great one, though I'm not sure it solves our immediate lack of right sided attacking width, as he looks far more accomplished in defence than attack. But at least we signed someone for the first team, FINALLY.

##6\. Aging defensive-midfielders
Mourinho's signing of Matic was an ok, if typically short-sighted one**. Matic followed his good first season with his worst Premier League campaign (not helped by injury). He's functional, but shouldn't be more than a squad player at a club of United's stature, and seems to be on the decline. Herrera has had two good seasons in five years at United (2014/15 and 2016/17).

^** ^It's ^odd ^that ^Ed ^allowed ^this ^signing ^but ^not ^Alderweireld...

**What has changed/will change?**

Nothing helpful so far. We failed to offer Herrera the sort of contract he was holding out for, and he's off to Ligue 1. IMO he's not worth the money he's getting from PSG and, although this will be a blow to the dressing room, it shouldn't be a blow on the pitch provided we sign any decent defensively minded midfielder. Matic is on the books for next season with an option for a further year (which I suggest we don't take).

We needed younger reinforcements here before Herrera's departure. We certainly do now he's gone. Mario Lemina would be a solid if unspectacular replacement for Herrera, but we're going to need a replacement for Matic as well.

##7\. General lack of work-rate and fitness
We were the third laziest team in the Premier League last year behind only West Ham and Cardiff. The clubs we should be seriously competing with are all in the top 9 for distance covered. This is totally unacceptable. Mourinho complained about last year's pre-season preparations being disrupted by the world cup, but other teams had this same problem and dealt with it better, so as the head coach he surely has to take some blame for himself.

**What has changed/will change?**

That remains to be seen. United must simply must work harder next year and must prepare correctly over the next month. This is the one problem I have real hope and expectation will be sorted out.

##8\. Wage-structure and ongoing contract negotiations
We really, really shit the bed when we signed Sanchez. Not only has he been awful since joining, but his bloated contract has torn-up any semblance of a wage-structure and unsettled several players. Guys like De Gea are rightfully thinking that if Sanchez is worth 350k p/w, why aren't they?

**What has changed/will change?**

Well...Rashford just got 5-years 200k p/w. That's a lot for a 21 year-old who has much to prove. For reference, that's the same money De Gea's currently on. He is very valuable to the club as a home-grown player, and hopefully he builds on last year and makes that contract look like a bargain.

We're gonna have to decide what to do with De Gea. His uncertainty over his future must surely have played a role in him having probably his worst full Premier League season. I'd pay him, as he's a World-Class keeper who's likely not yet entered his prime.

Ultimately to settle things down we need to get rid of Sanchez, though that will likely necessitate paying him to play elsewhere.


##9\. Problem players
I'm mainly referring to Pogba and Lukaku here, but you could include others like Martial who's hearts don't appear to be in it.

If we learnt anything from the SAF years it has to be that no player is bigger than the club. You need to identify players who do not want to be here, and you need to have the resolve to get rid of them.

Beckham, Stam, van Nistelrooy, Keane, etc etc. Lots of great players were shown the door for undermining or disrespecting the club, or losing their focus.

**What has changed/will change?**

Nothing yet. Without an even vaguely acceptable bid yet we will be keeping players who are patently unhappy at the club. Solskjaer has taken a page from the SAF playbook and tried to deflect attention and blame back toward the media, but with the players themselves having literally been quoted angling for moves, this is a pretty transparent damage-control exercise.

If an acceptable bid comes in for Pogba and/or Lukaku, we should sell and reinvest.

##Conclusion/TL;DR

We have thus far done very little to solve any of our real problems, and I'm very disappointed that Woodward is still in charge of transfers, and that we've still done virtually nothing to address our squad weaknesses.

There is less than a month left till the start of the 2019/20 season. As it stands I have little cause for hope, and foresee another depressing season spent struggling for consistent form and vying for a top-4 finish.

The problems at the club are systemic, and change is needed almost from top to bottom. Realistically, until the board hires an actual experienced Technical Director/DoF, we will continue to see a total lack of direction in the transfer market, and we will continue to see managers fired when the real problems are above their heads.",reddevils

69,69,69,Can someone explain to me why we don‚Äôt have a director of football?,"It seems like we‚Äôve had so many good players come to the club over the past 6 years, they are average relative to their potential, leave, and then do well again at another club. We try to sign players and get rinsed as we don‚Äôt seem to have a long list of alternatives (particularly outside of the PL where there is less money).

What the fuck is going on? Why doesn‚Äôt the club bring someone in with prior experience as a D of F; who has an extensive network of contacts, and in depth knowledge of good players outside the PL. So we have more options.

Basically hammer down a play style and bring in players who suit and will develop. Bring in managers who will tweak rather than rework the style. We have boatloads of cash. We spend. But it goes nowhere. Because there is seemingly no vision at the club. Because we don‚Äôt seem to see alternatives to how we currently operate. 

I started supporting United in 2006 (am a foreign fan). I‚Äôve found at times over the past few years that I‚Äôm forcing myself to watch games as they aren‚Äôt enjoyable as a spectacle. I don‚Äôt even give a shit about trophies at this point. I just want to be excited to tune into a United game as I know I‚Äôm going to enjoy watching it. For one brief and glorious moment Ole brought that back. And then it fell apart as soon as he signed his contract. 

I know there are millions of other supporters internationally. But I honestly can‚Äôt image choosing to pick United over the alternatives anymore as someone just getting into the sport. It‚Äôs saddening to say the least. And it seems that while a director of football won‚Äôt instantly sort that, it can‚Äôt do anything other than be a positive for the club. So why are no steps seemingly being taken to fill the position? It seems like lip service rather than a sincere desire for change.

https://twitter.com/SimonPeach/status/1148818313616621569 Here we go!

https://twitter.com/sistoney67/status/1148818441408638976 Ole and Rashgod!

**6:06 AM BST:** Ole's here!

**6:08 AM BST:** Some government official of Western Oz is talking.

 https://twitter.com/sistoney67/status/1148821879035027457

&gt; 100,000 fans expected for Man Utd's two games in Perth, against Perth Glory and Leeds United. 'The whole town is being painted red'. Not literally of course.

**6:12 AM BST:** Now to Ole!

**6:13 AM BST:** [Ole was just asked if he knew what a ""quokka"" was.](https://www.natureaustralia.org.au/explore/australian-animals/meet-the-quokka/)

**6:14 AM BST:** Ole's been asked about Raiola and Pogba. Ole is saying that we have had no bids for any of our players. Our lads are on long contracts and we don't have to sell anyone.

**6:15 AM BST:** Ole going at the media a bit about that shite about a falling out between Lingard and Pogba.

**6:17 AM BST:** 2/2 questions about Pogba. Ole says again no bids for any of our players.

**6:17 AM BST:** Stone asking where the ruthlessness is.

**6:19 AM BST:** Ole's dismissing another Pogba question. We've got time on his contract, Ole's had no problems with Pogba. No bids for players.

https://twitter.com/sistoney67/status/1148823833731670016

&gt; OGS says 'no quick fix' re squad. Says no bid received for any @ManUtd player.

https://twitter.com/sistoney67/status/1148823998312013825

&gt; OGS: ""We are Man Utd, we don‚Äôt have to sell players. I don‚Äôt want to call it an agenda against Paul. He has a heart of gold. He has never been a problem.""

OGS: ‚ÄúWe know last year was disappointing. Also know what to aim for this year. Have to close the gap. Have trophies to fight for. That‚Äôs what MU is about - bouncing back after a difficult season.‚Äù

OGS: ""We're Man United, we don't have to sell. We don't have to overpay either. It's about buying the right players for the right price.""

https://twitter.com/sistoney67/status/1148824559828647937?s=19

&gt;OGS: ""We are still in the market and looking to do some business. We are patient. We don‚Äôt have to sell and we don‚Äôt have to overpay.""

https://twitter.com/sistoney67/status/1148824962049835009

&gt; OGS on @ManUtd fans: ""They want us to be successful. The loudest ones are not the greatest or the best fans. When I am out there and speaking to them they are all very positive. They want to see us win again.""

OGS: ""[In training yesterday] Mason yesterday, Bang, bang, bang. Three chances, three goals.""

https://twitter.com/sistoney67/status/1148825665875013632

&gt; OGS: ""Mason (Greenwood) will definitely play more games. He has grown a lot in the summer. He was our best player against Cardiff.""

**6:26 AM BST:** Ole telling Simon Stone that he was quiet today.

https://twitter.com/sistoney67/status/1148826087578673157

&gt; OGS says Sanchez will have three weeks off but will be fit when he returns. On De Gea contract: ""We hope DDG contract will get sorted. I am positive. We are lucky and happy to have him.""

[Please refer to this thread regarding our new rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/cb0p88/meta_in_the_know_announcement_thread/).

We are banning any ""ITK"" posts. It has been difficult to truly verify the validity of these types of users and led to abusive behavior and even doxxing in some cases.

We are more than happy to have people discussing transfer news and rumors, but there will be no more referencing unknown sources at the club. Moving forward, anyone who believes they have inside info a la bloodgate is welcome to send in a modmail. However such posts/comments made without prior mod approval will be removed

It has been mentioned, but the toxicity and abuse towards the sub, within the sub, and towards other subs has been too high. We as moderators have our share of blame in this, but we want to stress that this kind of behavior is not acceptable and we are taking these measures primarily to avoid these things. We want /r/reddevils to be a place where anyone and everyone is welcome to discuss and enjoy the best club on earth without fear of abuse or ridicule.

Which leads us to 2 other small reminders. The report button is your friend, we are way more likely to find and remove and/or ban rule breaking comments if you report them. The downvote button is not a ""I disagree or don't like your statement button"", better discussion is generally had by using the upvote button more liberally and avoiding the downvote one whenever possible.

‚Ä¢ He joined us from Juventus for ¬£18m in Summer 2017 (so expect a signing of at LEAST ¬£18)

Now that everyone's had a bit to calm down and the mod team had time to discuss, we want to address what happened yesterday and talk about the state of the sub moving forward.

**Firstly**: we can again confirm that [/u/spoofex](https://www.reddit.com/u/spoofex/) has deleted his account and stepped down from the moderation team as a result of abuse he received. Whether you agreed or disagreed with his posting methods, I hope we can all agree that abuse is over the line. We do want to be clear though, this is not about Spoofex in particular. Multiple users have face unwarranted abuse and we believe that a line needs to be drawn on the situation.

As a side note, we are not currently looking for more moderators to replace his spot. We will address mod numbers at a later time

**Secondly**: We are discontinuing the Muppet Thread. Having multiple transfer threads has led to unfortunate divisions within the sub. We will therefore be condensing all transfer talk into one thread, the transfer thread, pursuant to the transfer thread rules currently in place. If you would like to discuss other United related events or have less serious discussion, please use the Daily Discussion thread.

**Thirdly**: We are banning any ""ITK"" posts. It has been difficult to truly verify the validity of these types of users and led to abusive behavior and even doxxing in some cases.

We are more than happy to have people discussing transfer news and rumors, but there will be no more referencing unknown sources at the club. Moving forward, anyone who believes they have inside info a la bloodgate is welcome to send in a modmail. However such posts/comments made without prior mod approval will be removed

**Fourthly**: It has been mentioned, but the toxicity and abuse towards the sub, within the sub, and towards other subs has been too high. We as moderators have our share of blame in this, but we want to stress that this kind of behavior is not acceptable and we are taking these measures primarily to avoid these things. We want [/r/reddevils](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/) to be a place where anyone and everyone is welcome to discuss and enjoy the best club on earth without fear of abuse or ridicule.

Which leads us to 2 other small reminders. The report button is your friend, we are way more likely to find and remove and/or ban rule breaking comments if you report them. The downvote button is not a ""I disagree or don't like your statement button"", better discussion is generally had by using the upvote button more liberally and avoiding the downvote one whenever possible.

To add to the above, it is not unlikely that we as a sub will face ridicule from other subs. There's no need to retaliate in kind. If people come to the sub looking to cause problems please report them and move on. If you don't want to face those kinds of comments, we would encourage you to either ignore the comments themselves or stay off of those subs short term.

As a small aside, anyone coming here from Twitter: Please read over the rules and be aware of both those and general posting etiquette.

**Fifthly**: In speaking with the the users running the muppetiers account, we understand that as a result of these planned changes they have made the decision to open the muppetiers sub for muppet-related discussion. For anyone that enjoys muppetry and/or ITK stuff, you are all welcome to participate there (and here, as well), but we have made the decision to focus this sub on more substantial discussion and will be avoiding those subjects as mentioned.

Now, this post will also stand as a discussion point on the above subject or a place for users to ask questions. Please understand that there are some things we cannot or will not discuss but we will be as transparent as possible.",reddevils

112,112,112,Actual Unpopular Opinion: I don't think things are quite that bad,"Let's not forget the way the team started when Ole first took charge. Those players, minus Herrera, are still there. When we were clicking in the first part of the year, we were easily a top 4 side. If we sign Bruno Fernandes, who is better going forward than Herrera, and play Daniel James or Chong on the right, along with AWB at RB, I think we will be alright. Arsenal are shambolic and Chelsea are in a horrible state of affairs as well. After a summer and pre season of building up fitness and Ole trying to play the right football, I think we will comfortably make top 4. I feel my position would be strengthened if we signed Harry Maguire, but nonetheless, those are my honest opinions. I definitely see how it could go pear shaped halfway through the season, but I do not think this is blind optimism. There is a long way to go to be the best in England/Europe, but I think we can be reasonably hopeful for a top 4 finish and a deep run in the Europa League. Thoughts?

EDIT: I realize the owners are bloodsuckers and Ed Woodward is a power hungry control freak who won't hire a DOF. I know the structure of the club is pathetic. I'm purely talking about the football side of things.",reddevils

Rest of Article for those interested.

*Ander Herrera‚Äôs transfer to PSG was made official last week, with the midfielder joining the French champions as a free agent from Manchester United.*

*His arrival has not been met with a great fanfare from the club‚Äôs local media and there‚Äôs doubt over what his role in the club‚Äôs project will be. The Spaniard will have to impress quickly to convince people he‚Äôs been signed as more than simply an asset to sell on in a future transfer window.*

*Marca today do make a big deal of the transfer, or at least a big deal of their chat with the footballer.*

*One of the questions put to Herrera is why he chose to leave Manchester United despite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanting to keep him at the club. *

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like looking at the past,‚Äù Herrera said. ‚ÄúBut there were differences regarding the project and my importance within it. I was very happy, I have a lot to thank the club for, the fans and also Solskjaer. He did a lot for me to stay, but things didn‚Äôt happen. They arrived late and, by then, I‚Äôd already made the decision to play in Paris.*

*‚ÄúI am very happy to have made that decision because I am enjoying this magnificent city, this beautiful stadium and this club, which has a glamour few can match.‚Äù*

*Judging his time at Old Trafford, he explained: ‚ÄúIt has been fantastic. In five years I have played 189 games and I have been important for all the coaches. It is true that that the MVP (Sir Matt Busby award, 2016/17) makes one feel special and very happy, but I keep every moment that I have lived.‚Äù*

*Marca put it to Herrera that he had ‚Äònumerous offers‚Äô when leaving Manchester United, and asked why he chose PSG: ‚ÄúBecause to leave United, the biggest team in England, you need something like PSG, which is the biggest in France. I could not play in another English club. The PSG is a group in continuous development and which is in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.*

*‚ÄúI visited it as a tourist and I fell in love. Now I have the chance to play for his team, which has a very high ceiling and goals, and which has some of the best players in the world.‚Äù*

*Inevitably, Herrera was also asked about former teammate David de Gea potentially moving to PSG, and he answered: ‚ÄúDavid is my friend and is one of the best in the world, for me top 3, but here there are already two great goalkeepers. There is Areola, and Trapp returns after completing a great stage at Eintracht. You have to respect the people who are already there and expect Trapp and Areola to have a great season.‚Äù**",reddevils

165,165,165,What is Ole's philosphy ?,"Serious thread.

&amp;#x200B;

""The United Way"" is not a philosophy and Fergies imprint cannot be mimicked in any way. Ole arrived and we pressed higher and played more forward passes.

Games went on and our xG and xA began to show that luck was more on our side than an actual style of play. Towards the end of the season, our record was awful and we had reverted back to ""parking the bus"". The only problem is our defensive fragility was completely exposed.

Now this summer, we expected 4-5 players in and 4-5 out. Reality is we probably will sell 1-3 (two of them being Rom and Pogba). We potentially might not sign anyone else and if we do they will most likely be ""young and hungry"".

Our philosophy is all over the place from the players we are interested in (Maguire, Longstaff and Bruno) to the players we have retained. They do not adhere to any style of play and have been proven, shit players. We seemingly are trying to recreate ""a great British core"" which is an awful way to rebuild a dying football club. We need a system and a manager who is tactically aware.

Ole could be that guy but has rarely shown any initiative and instead of attempting to make an impact on the team his stance is always reverting back to the ""its the united way"". He promised that he would be successful and that some players would never play for this club again which has proven to be a lie. Our style hasn't dramatically changed after 5 months with a new coach. Flashback to our previous managers and their imprint was very defined 5-6 months into their tenure.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: At Modle, he did imprint a style of play but there are two very key talking points about his career.

1. The Norwegian league at that time and still is essentially equivalent to our league 1/2. Ole, his players and staff all acknowledged the lack of technical football within the league. Ole was credited for brining technical, fast football to the league. He essentially took basic modern-day football and applied the same philosophies within an old-mentality league. Modle was faster and sharper than other teams as they didn't ""route-one"". Modle have not won any trophies under Ole since 2012/13. 
2. When he joined Cardiff, Ole promised the fans that they would play ""fast, exciting football"" and that they would dramatically reshape the foundation of the club. He instead got them into the relegation zone and signed too many players that did not adhere to any type of style. His singings from Molde were particularly worrisome as they couldn't get into the team nor adapt. When he was fired from Cardiff they were in a far worse position than when Ole came into the club. 

This is not an #OleOut thread but I feel like these points should be discussed more. Molde were the first Norwegian team to play ""modern-day football"" but they were soon caught up by their rivals. Ole still hasn't made any real impact with these players and our constant changing on formations begins to show our lack of a plan. AWB (great) and James (good hopefully) are good signings as a start BUT Ole essentially acknowledged that we needed far more in this summer. Ed is not solely in charge of transfers. The actual transfer system is complicated as there are so many different departments involved. Matt Judge is our chief negotiator and he evidently sucks. The scouting network is involved and the management needs to also have their say on targets. It is true that the once-great Manchester United are now rapidly declining in terms of their pull.",reddevils
166,166,166,Saul Niguez ownership and release clause: Complex nature revealed by Football leaks,"According to [documents recovered by football leaks](https://oload.biz/f/jISDScLe59w/AtleÃÅtico_de_Madrid_%26_Quality_Football_Ireland_Limited_-_Saul_NÃÉiguez.pdf) the following is true:

- Quality Sports investments bought 40% of player's economic rights when he was 16 by making a payment of 1m.

- Saul has a 136m release clause at Atletico right now (from other reports) but only 60% of it would be paid to Atletico while rest 40% would go to QSI (headed by Jorge Mendes and former United executive Peter Kenyon)

- If QSI agrees to transfer and Saul doesn't, Atletico will be forced to pay 40% of 135m, so 54m to QSI and the full ownership of the player would be transferred to Atletico Madrid.

222,222,222,How did you become a Man United Fan? || Origin Story ||,"How and when did you guys fall in love with Manchester United? I am just curious about how people end up associating themselves with a club especially when they are not from Manchester or even England. Was it a player? Was it a particular game? Or was it a kit? 

P.S. The last one is apparently not uncommon. I have a friend who is a massive Everton fan who started off as a toffee after he fell in love with their 2010/11 kit!

My Story:

Being a mid 90s kid, I grew up during the time when Manchester United was consistently at the top of English football. My father was a United fan since the 90s (about the time football broadcasting started in my country). He worked long hours and hence I barely got time to hang out with him during the week. But on weekends, I wanted to spend a lot of time with my dad. So every Saturday/ Sunday evening he would sit down in front of the telly with some snacks and shout at the TV screen every so often when he thought Ronaldo was doing unnecessary stepovers. I was like 7-8 at the time and had no clue what was happening. I just joined him and that's how I got into football. 

I remember not understanding anything but getting excited when Ronaldo and Rooney took on players for fun. I thought of Sir Alex as this old guy who chewed gum all the time and would get hyperactive and angry in short bursts.

Time flew by and without even realizing it I fell in love with the game and the club. But in my early teens, when internet and social media were a new thing, I was super active on a Man United fan Facebook group. I could barely relate to other fans. Yes, I had watched a lot of Man United but had no knowledge about the history and the heritage of the club. I had no access to such stuff apart from Man United specials on ESPN and Star Sports (Local channel that broadcasted the EPL). So, it was from around 2007 that I learned about the club, the rivalries, the legends, etc. I stopped saying Man U, understood the dislike for You Know Who and truly appreciated the work of Sir Alex Ferguson over the previous decade. 

I recently visited Manchester and Old Trafford for the first time and it was surreal. I never knew I could be so emotionally attached to a place I had never visited. It was overwhelming. 

As I sit here looking forward to the day I watch my first game at Old Trafford, my head just ran through the years of memories and it got me thinking of other fans and their origin story (if I can call it that).

Looking forward to hearing your story!",reddevils

Matic is good but we all know how just doesn't have the stamina to be regular starter. Back ups? Pereira, Mata and McTominy?

We specifically are light-handed on moderating in this thread because the idea is so we can have a bit of fun. Folks can post almost anything they want and you can go full muppet about the newest social media post someone has liked.

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

Have fun doing what you're doing, and discuss the anonymous ITKs legitimacy all you want, but targeting individuals, and/or haranguing / harassing members of our subreddit is a no-no.

243,243,243,De Gea's Legacy,"Hi all,

In light of the news and general expectation that De Gea will most likely be penning a new deal at United, it got me thinking of where he's at now in terms of the legacy he'll leave when he does call it a day at United, whether for a transfer or potentially retirement.

Didn't have enough time to deep-dive thoroughly enough to get all goalkeepers' appearance stats, but anyways, here goes: at 362 appearances, De Gea is closing in on Schmeichel's 398 appearances and Alex Stepney is up there at the top with 539 (7th all-time most appearances for United).

If De Gea averages the 50-odd appearances per season he has in recent years for the reported 4 years we're extending, that could make him our highest-appearing goalkeeper of all time, which would be an amazing achievement for someone who started his tenure off with so much doubt surrounding him (and, in my opinion at least, undeservedly has some surrounding him again).

So, I guess now that I've put these numbers out, my question would be: if De Gea were to achieve that feat, and possibly only get a few more trophies along the way, where would he rank for you among our all-time goalkeepers? I know he might never reach the trophy-laden heights of Schmeichel (15 trophies with United vs DDG's current 7), but just figured I'd see what everyone thinks!",reddevils

257,257,257,Scouting the Current CB Targets,"Someone can probably do this far far better than me (and please expand upon what I have in the comments if you can), but with all the recent buzz about bids for CBs, may be beneficial to break them down.

I am ranking these by the likelihood of them happening:

**Harry Maguire (Leicester City):**

Age: 26

Size: 6'4 (193 cm), 220¬†lbs (99.8 kg)

Dominant Foot: Right / Plays as LCB for Leicester and NT

WhoScored Season Rating: **7.01**

Stats: 3 Goals / 1 Assist

Discipline: 6 Yellows / 1 Red

**Strengths**: A vocal leader in the defence, size and strength, set piece weapon and great in the air, pushing forward and composure on the ball, excellent passer and can initiate a counter. He won, on average 3.8 aerial duels a match, 4.9 clearances a match, 6.2 long balls a game, and an 85% passing percentage. He is also still years off what should be considered his prime as a defender. With proper coaching he could very well reach world class status. Helps with the Home Grown quota. Currently first choice center back with the National Team, which adds some prestige. Premier League proven. *Maguire looked far better with the appointment of Brendan Rodgers, as he was better suited to a deeper line and the counter attacking system Rodgers employed (credit to u/*[*Dunkaegon*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dunkaegon/)*)*

**Weaknesses**: Athleticism, slower than the current gold-standard for World Class backs (VVD, Ramos, and Koulibaly), needs a strong DM to cover him in situations where he can get beat on the counter due to lack of awareness and poor positioning, and can be a reckless defender in 1:1 situations. As we do not have a strong DM and are not sure how the Shaw and AWB pairing will offer in cover, Maguire's positioning may pose a significant problem if he tries to play further up the pitch, placing himself out of position for the counter, though this will all depend on what kind of line we are going to implement next season.

From LCFC fans:

""Strengths are on the ball he is one of the best in the league, both driving out of defence and passing. He's also good in the air, physically and will definitely be a good leader of any defence. However he is quite slow compared to some top class defenders like VVD and Ramos. He also does not have the best awareness or positioning which leads to the odd mistake. Ndidi does a great job of covering him and considering you lot haven't got that type of ball winner right now it would definitely be a big problem ""

""IMO he's worth the prices that are being quoted. Don't let Leicester's indifference to him being sold make you think we're pulling a fast one on you. Leicester is currently blessed with an abundance of quality in the CB position so if Maguire were to be sold that would open the door for one of our many prospects to take his starting spot. And if he's not then we're still left with an amazing player ourselves who seems to want to stay. It's one of those situations where it's a win-win for the club no matter what. To add to that he's not trying to force his way out like Mahrez did, which demonstrates Maguire's loyalty and ability to be a team leader and not disrupt the dressing room atmosphere. He's basically the opposite of a diva, which I think is the kind of player ManU would appreciate at this moment.""

Quoted price: &gt; ¬£ 70m

**Issa Diop**

Age: 22

Size: 6'4 (194 cm), 202 lbs (92 kg)

Dominant Foot: Right / Plays as RCB for West Ham

WhoScored Season Rating: **6.89**

Stats: 1 goal

Discipline: 4 Yellows/ 0 Reds

**Strengths**: Tall, broad and imposing, Diop is a bully in the back. He plays with a great deal of physicality, and looks like he has the potential to evolve into a world class player like VVD or Koulibaly, as he grows into a more technical, ball-playing CB. He has great covering speed and has shown on numerous occasions his ability to get back into position to cover the right-back or to stop players breaking past him at pace. Premier League proven. Will only grow in terms of technical ability. His discipline has improved immensely. He did not receive a single red in the PL this year, and actually has not been sent off in his previous three seasons in the top flight. Impressive composure in terms of defending and positioning. Also, playing within what might be a true golden generation of French central defenders, Diop may well be inspired and driven to perform at the highest level to attempt to secure his spot during future call ups. *Diop also has been more exposed to attackers running at him a lot more at a club like West Ham than he would if he were playing at a top 6 club. (credit to u/*[*Dunkaegon*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dunkaegon/)*)*

**Weaknesses**: Diop brings the least to the table, out of all of the targets, in terms of technical ability and the ability to play out the back. He is not as composed with the ball at his feet, and can misplace quite a few passes per match. This might not allow him to slot into the side comfortably, but these are abilities that can be improved upon and will grow naturally with time and patience. If Koulibaly is truly out of reach (and I think he is), then Diop can be the young signing that can grow into a player of that value.

Quoted price: &gt; ¬£ 50m

**Ruben Dias**

Age: 22

Size: 6'1 (186 cm), 170¬†lbs (77 kg)

Dominant Foot: Right / Plays as RCB for Benfica and LCB for NT

WhoScored Season Rating: **6.96**

Stats: 3 Goals / 1 Assist

Discipline: 10 Yellows/ 0 Reds

**Strengths:** Quite young and mature beyond his age, Dias has already established himself in the NT set up and has proven to be a stabilizing force for SLB. Despite his leaner stature, he averaged a hefty 3.2 aerial duels won, per match, 3.4 clearances, and average 1.4 tackles a game. His positioning is superb. Like are other targets, he is comfortable playing out the back. 86% passing rate and 4.4 long balls a game, would make him a perfect fit as we look to field a more attacking side, brisk on the counter in the upcoming season. At 22, he still has the ability to grow and bulk up, which could make him an even more imposing defender. He also impressed against us in the Champions League. That has to count for something.

**Weaknesses**: Aggressiveness. He earned 10 yellow cards in league play this past season. The Premier League is a tougher, more challenging league, and he will have to temper down or could very well follow the path of the CBs we are trying to replace (Bailly, Rojo, Jones). He is still a tad unproven. The Portuguese League isn't quite the same quality as the PL or Serie A. His performances for the National Team instill confidence, but there could still be a significant learning curve for him to overcome. If we want an immediate fix on our back-line, Dias may not be the immediate fix. But he surely has the potential to link up with a fellow Benfica alumni and lead our back-line for years to come.

**Quoted price**: Release clause reported to be between **‚Ç¨50-60m**, but with Benfica attempting to increase it to ‚Ç¨80m to maximize value. Every indication that they will not settle for any less than the release clause, especially after Madrid met Felix's valuation early this summer.

**Kalidou Koulibaly (Napoli)**

Age: 28

Size: 6'2 (186 cm), 220¬†lbs (90 kg)

Dominant Foot: Right / Plays both LCB and RCB, but primarily LCB for Napoli and NT

WhoScored Season Rating: **7.06**

Stats: 2 Goals / 2 Assist

Discipline: 10 Yellows / 1 Red

**Strengths:** Koulibaly is a physical freak.He is also rapid. He can cover ground with the best of them when caught out of position. This is where he is a considerable upgrade over Maguire, and puts him on the level of VVD or Ramos. He is comfortable on the ball, and can initiate attacks going forward. In terms of passing, he averaged 4.5 long balls a game, and an impressive 89% passing rate. He is still only 28 years old, and is entering his prime as a defender. He has also been a stalwart for Napoli. I do not think he has missed a single match for them (please correct if this is wrong). That is something that will make United fans salivate, but I am going to address this in the weaknesses as well.

**Weaknesses**: At 6‚Äô2 he is slightly less of an aerial threat than Maguire, having averaged 2.2 aerial duels won a game and averaged 3.9 clearances a game, but at his height, he is still an impact player in that regard. Koulibaly's positioning is not perfect, and instead of using his pace to get in front of players, he can lean on the rash tackle from time to time, and this leads to a commitment of fouls. A friend of mine who religiously watches Serie A, said he was quite lucky to walk away from some challenges with only a yellow to show for.  Like I said above, he is an absolute stalwart and has rarely missed any time for Napoli. This is great to hear. But also, the pessimist in me tends to think that an injury crisis could be on the horizon. That kind of stability does not last for ever, and especially not for someone who relies heavily on their athleticism.

*Note: Koulibaly suffered a drop in form after he started getting targeted by racist behavior and chants towards the second half of this past season. This is something that is far less likely to happen in England. (credit to u/*[*Dunkaegon*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dunkaegon/)*)*

Quoted price: &gt; ¬£ 120m (release clause of ‚Ç¨150m) Honestly, this is not going to happen. Napoli are pushing for the title this year. They are making massive investments in the squad and just brought in a top CB to pair with him. He is their most integral player. Yes the 50m or so difference between Maguire and him seems like not that much when Koulibaly is arguably a top 3 CB in the world. But Napoli don't want to sell. Unless we want to obliterate the transfer record for a CB and our own transfer record, I do not see him joining this week. But won't completely rule it out.

PLAYERS WE ARE NOT *CURRENTLY CONNECTED* WITH BUT ARE ROUTINELY DISCUSSED AS OPTIONS:

Toby Alderweireld

Milan ≈†kriniar

We have been connected with these players within the past season, but there has been no rumblings from reputable journos to date in regards to these players.

274,274,274,International Duty and the Upcoming Season,"One thing I haven't seen commented on much is how few United players are participating in the various international tournaments this summer. Currently, the African Cup of Nations, the Copa America and the Gold Cup are ongoing, as well as the Euro U21 Championships, and these are the players from the top 6 Premier League sides.


- Man City (7): Mahrez (Algeria), Gabriel Jesus, Fernandinho, Ederson (all Brazil), Aguero, Otamendi (both Argentina), Foden (England U21)

- Liverpool (5): Salah (Egypt), Mane (Senegal), Firmino, Alisson (both Brazil), Keita (Guinea)

- Spurs (4): Aurier (Ivory Coast), Wanyama (Kenya), Foyth (Argentina), Sanchez (Colombia)

- Chelsea (4): Willian (Brazil), Pulisic (USA), Abraham, Mount (both England U21)

- Arsenal (4): El Neny (Egypt), Iwobi (Nigeria), Torreira (Uruguay), Guendouzi (France U21)

- Man Utd (2): Alexis Sanchez (Chile), Wan-Bissaka (England U21)

I only included U21 players who stand a chance of being a part of the first team next season. 

The fact that there are so few United players in these tournaments is mainly a reflection of the majority of the squad being from Europe. Romero and Bailly probably would have been involved had they not been injured. And Fred just wasn't called up. 

But there is a positive to this as well. After last year's World Cup, there was a lot of talk about how the players were tired starting the season. So hopefully this means that United's players will be more rested and carrying fewer injuries than their rivals. 

Especially for teams with countries who go the distance in the AFCON which doesn't end until July 19th. That is only 3 weeks before the opening fixtures for the Premier League. For example, it's not impossible that Salah and Mane won't return to training until after the season has started. 

Meanwhile, the only United player to get significant game time is Alexis Sanchez and he is probably the one player we needed to play a lot and play well as it will hopefully boost his confidence, or at the very least, put him in the shop window given how well he has done in the Copa America. 

Obviously this is all digging for small crumbs of comfort and trying to find any ways to close the gap from last season. But you never know, one or more of the teams above United may struggle as a result of this.",reddevils

299,299,299,State of the Sub - July 2019,"Hi all,

We haven't done this in two years so there are quite a few things to go through here. So strap in! We intend to do these annually from now on.

***
Let's just start with a few announcements. Things that have been implemented since the last update, to provide a brief recap of what has happened in the subreddit.

***

**""Monday Meme-aways""**

Over the years we've had quite a firm stance on the no meme's rules on the subreddit. However, we relaxed on our position mid last year to accommodate subscribers who want memes by setting up the designated ""Meme Monday"" threads for memes. Our main rule still applies and standalone meme posts will be removed but feel free to use the designated ""Meme threads"" and the comments section as you please.

***

**A Muppets World**

We've also introduced the ""Transfer Muppets Threads"" for all the transfer water-cooler gossip and in-the-know (ITK) tittle-tattle. Do take note that information shared in these threads are not to be taken as gospel. We had to have a separate avenue for information coming from unverifiable, unattributable sources and as such anything shared in them threads are to be taken with a fistful of salt. 

It is also to be noted that these threads have led to a useful community led initiative that is the ""Muppetiers Programme"". /u/jroades267 and /u/ubergorp have taken it upon them to collate and post information anonymously from people claiming to have ITK information. They've been doing so independently, without any affiliation with the moderators of /r/reddevils. Despite the growing pains and challenges they face, we'd like to commend community led efforts that aim to contribute to the subreddit..

***

**/r/reddevils Community Awards**

/r/reddevils is also officially apart of reddit's community awards! Community Awards are awards unique to our community, and subscribers can give them to each other as a substitute for reddit's silver/gold/platinum awards. [These are the awards currently available but we're certainly looking to add more over time.](https://i.imgur.com/twSk0kq.png) A small portion of coins from Community Award purchases will be deposited into the /r/reddevils‚Äôs coin balance and these coins will be used to reward members for their contribution when it comes to our official /r/reddevils Awards!

***

**A Sticky Summer**

For those of you who still like to read the sub, but not so fussed about the Transfer related talk, /u/zSolaris has laid out plans for our Summer of daily discussion threads, where we've got themed daily discussion thread for people to chime-in on. These discussion threads have been scheduled for the entire transfer window and we'd like to get your opinions on anything you'd like to see included in these threads.

***

**Rules, Regulations No More Tribulations**

The Rules for this subreddit have been updated and we've included a few new rules to make /r/reddevils a better place for everyone. We've added the following rules that might be worth having a look at:

* **Rule #10: Press Conference Quotes.** Press conference quoted are to kept to one thread to stop the rat race to spam the sub with multiple quotes from multiple twitter accounts. However, on occasion, we allow one or two posts from out top tiered journalists if it's been a slow day and it better helps to facilitate discussion.

* **Rule #12: No editorializing of post titles.** If you're going to make a submission (news stories, tweets, instagram posts, etc.), please do not editorialize title. Leave the original title or use the content of the social media post, whenever possible, as the discussion about the submission will be largely based of your editorialized title rather than the actual content of the submission. Minor edits to make a title clearer are encouraged (i.e., changing ""best player"" to ""[Juan Mata] best player"" to avoid ""click-baitey"" titles.

* **Rule #13: Banned Sources/Content or Illegal Streams.** We keep a running list of banned sources in the [Transfer Tier Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/wiki/transfer-reliability-guide) as Tier 5, these are sources that are known to be poor in content and will not be allowed in the subreddit. We also ban content that may attract unwanted attention from reddit administrators, specifically illegal streams. While we understand trying to watch our team can be hard, all non-legal streams and requests will be removed. Reddit admins have been on a mission to eradicate any community carrying illegal content and we don't want to give them any reason to take a look at us.

***On a side note, please do take note that posts that need to be removed are easily spotted by our moderators but comments that need action might slip through our fingers in bigger threads. We're going to need your help to highlight these comments using the report button.***

***

**Subreddit Census**

A /r/reddevils census was finally conducted after a 7 year gap and it might be an interesting read for anyone wanting to see the dynamics of our user group. We intend to do this annually moving forward. [Link to /r/reddevils census](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/c0wv4h/summer_series_2019_rreddevils_census_results/) 

***

**Mod Matters**

Our moderation team has also expanded over the last year. We've welcomed two new additions in /u/sauce_murica and /u/crebtheberc to ensure that our subreddit is being moderated at all times throughout the day. For those who were unaware, /u/spoofex took a brief sabbatical after years of moderating this place and rejoined the mod team recently. We did a recent AMA as part of our summer series, do let us know if you'd like for it to be an annual thing. It provided a place where you could ask questions related to how our subreddit was run and we felt that it helped clear some doubts on how we moderate this place. [\[Link to AMA\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/bvjow7/summer_series_we_are_the_mods_of_rreddevils_ama/)

***

**Subscriber Count Update**

Our subreddit has also expanded quite a bit over the last few years. To put things into context, we had 60,629 subscribers the time we did a ""State of the Sub"" post in 2017 and the number has increased to 167,415 subscribers in just two years. As things stand, we're currently the second biggest footy club sub on reddit just behind /r/liverpoolfc who have a 2000 subscriber lead on us. 

***

Feel free to discuss on any of the updates mentioned above and give us your opinion on the changes. We will listen to the general vibe of the sub and make any necessary changes if need be.

***

**Transparency Report** 

We've banned 631 users and unbanned 155 users in the past 12 months (a significant increase that is expected of with the sudden increase in subscriber count), of which about 138 are bots. The most common reasons for bans are:

* Self-Promotion without Contribution (this includes the bots)
* Brigading/trolling other teams subreddits (both outsiders coming here and users here attacking other subreddits)


We have received 0 requests through modmail to provide sponsorship or endorsements to a product or company in exchange for goods in the last year. We've had a long-running stance that the mod team will not accept products, payment, or goods in exchange for promoted posts/biasing the community. This message clearly has been received as we've seen no-one ask for a long time now.",reddevils

309,309,309,A bot for Going for Gold competition,"#A bot for Going For Gold

Hello fellow reddevils. 

/u/Pedantic_Pat has been running this competition wonderfully and I thought I could help him out by making things easier for him. I saw a post two weeks ago from /u/Pedantic_Pat about wanting someone to make a new bot to calculate points for next season of Going for Gold. So, I made one and added more features to it to make it self-managed.


###Here are some of the stuff the bot can do:

* Submit a new post for a match's prediction
* When the match begins, it collects the users' predictions and store it
* Calculates points based on the match's result automatically
* Posts the points table in the next match's post (I am still working on this)
* Supports EPL, UEFA competitions for now. (I am using a football website's API to get match details. They don't provide details for FA and League Cup sadly)  
* Keeps track of points for individual match types(EPL, Europa,etc) as well as the overall score.  


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

###Game information: &amp;nbsp;

* The scoring mechanism remains the same as /u/Pedantic_Pat's. 
* The structure for a prediction remains the same as  /u/Pedantic_Pat's as well. The only difference is that the user will be making a new comment and will not be replying under /u/Pedantic_Pat's scoreline comment.



How do the league points work?

Correct Result (Win, Draw, Loss): +2 points

Correct Scoreline: +3 points

Each correct goal+scorer: +1 point

Best prediction of game (winner of gold): +5 points

If you lost out on gold due to tiebreaker, you get +3 points


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

####More information about this:  

I will be posting the threads using this account. I am also planning to make the bot's code open source soon, so that anyone else willing to contribute can do so. There are still some things I wish to do with this bot - like, replying back a user's points when someone asks for it (something like the goal-bot), and add more match types in the future(FA cup, League cup).

I reached out to /u/Pedantic_Pat about this but didn't talk to other mods yet. So, I thought of making this thread to discuss about this. I hope I made something useful!",reddevils

Pro :
1. Ball playing ability and good passing range
2. Rarely doing stupid mistake unlike bailly, jones, rojo, smalling
3. Not injury prone like bailly, jones, rojo (he play 2400 minutes for villa last season)
4. He is quick for CB, if we play high line he is reliable to recover from counter.


Cons
1. Defense ability still unproven in EPL, even though I think he is good enough especially on the ground 
2. Might be bullied against strong targetman 


Tl:dr he is similar to lindelof and partner them means we will be very comfortable with the ball and play from the back, but if we play against hoofball team who use giroud/deeney as their targetman even tho if we go against them we can sub smalling for axel.

Of course I still hope we sign a quality CB but if other club wants to rinse us I think Tuanzebe is our best bet.

Gerrard: 212 in 504  - 0.42
Lampard: 279 in 609 - 0.46
Scholes: 162 in 499 - 0.32

David Silva: 176 in 382 - 0.46

Read what you may of these stats. 

A few things I'm thinking of doing but my fingers hurt now

1. Because of their longevity, they've played in the pl as youngsters and the natural lack of consistency at that age would lower their stats. I can take similar periods of their careers even though they were perhaps in different leagues.

2. Compare at similar ages that pogba has been with us since he returned.

3. Try to get an overall picture by taking into account other factors like tackling, shooting accuracy, dribbles, etc.

368,368,368,Transcript of AWB's First Interview with MUTV (Inside),"AARON WAN-BISSAKA: HIS FIRST INTERVIEW AT UNITED



The England Under-21 international has¬†completed his move from Crystal Palace, becoming Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's second signing of the summer transfer window following¬†the arrival of Wales winger Daniel James from Swansea City¬†earlier this month.¬†
Aaron will wear the no.29 shirt for the Reds - the same number he wore at his former club Palace.¬†
We sat down with the 21-year-old full-back at the Aon Training Complex for an exclusive first interview, in which he describes his feelings about moving to Old Trafford, discusses his development to date, explains his experience of playing against United and gives a message to the supporters.
Aaron, the deal is done! How does it feel to sign for Manchester United?
‚ÄúYeah I am excited to have finally signed for this team. Every kid wants to play for a team like this. I am grateful and it is an honour to represent this club. I think I will improve every step and learn different things around new team-mates. I think Man United is a big club, a big family, a big fan base, and I think they all stick together and are so tight together.‚Äù

A lot of people are very proud of your achievements in your young career so far and particularly your family. How happy are you that they can be part of this today?
‚ÄúYeah I am really happy. I can see that I have made them proud with this decision and where I have come from, how the journey started, and that makes me kick on and carry on. We stick together and we make decisions on everything. I personally think they know what is right for me and that is the decision I will make. It‚Äôs a good moment, especially for where we have come from, you know this tough journey up until now. It‚Äôs a good feeling.‚Äù

How did you transition from being a winger to one of the most highly-rated full-backs in England?
‚ÄúI think it started with a formation really, you know with wing-backs, and I was playing on the wing back then but we had to play with wing-backs so that is how I got used to it and got the feel of it. From that I enjoyed it and that is how it really all got started.‚Äù

When you were growing up, what sort of things were you trying to develop in your game and were there any players in particular you looked up to? You started out as a winger, right?
‚ÄúI started out as a striker. Growing up, I used to look at Thierry Henry and I just really wanted to do stuff that he did in the Premier League. That encouraged me to push on and try to make things happen.‚Äù

One of our former players Wilf Zaha has spoken about how hard it was to train against you. What was it like training against him and did you learn stuff about your own game?
‚ÄúYeah that is when I realised my actual strengths, from playing against him. It was not easy and it was always a challenge, but at the same time it helped me and made me realise what it is to play against players like him in the Premier League.‚Äù

Your one-on-one defending is unbelievable and you have got that nickname ‚ÄòSpider‚Äô. Tell us about that‚Ä¶ 
‚Äú'The Spider' is about the range and length of my legs when I'm lunging to tackle the ball. That's where the nickname comes from.‚Äù


What would you say are your best attributes as a player?
‚ÄúI would say dribbling, speed and tackling.‚Äù

You have played against United before so what was it like to play against Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and everybody else?
‚ÄúUnited [at Selhurst Park] was my second game in the Premier League and the game wasn‚Äôt going to be easy for me, I knew that. So with me I had to just concentrate and at the same time it was good to play against these players. These are superstars. I learned a lot from that game, playing against them, which has helped me in my development.‚Äù

Have you spoken to Ole and what did he say to you about Manchester United?
‚ÄúYeah I have spoken to him and he has told me how he feels about me. Ole has reassured me about his plans, what he is going to do with the team. That is something I want to be a part of. It was the gaffer‚Äôs decision and his plan to rebuild, and to bring the team back to where it is supposed to be. I wanted to be a part of that plan.‚Äù


You kept a clean sheet at Old Trafford last season ‚Äì what do you remember from that experience?

‚ÄúThat was my first time there. I couldn‚Äôt believe that stadium! As I said in one of the interviews back then, it was one of the best ones I have played at, for its size, the pitch, the fans and the noise. The atmosphere is always loud.‚Äú

How much are you looking forward to playing there in the red of United?
‚ÄúI am looking forward to it. I am excited and I can‚Äôt wait to get 

Finally, do you have a message for the fans who are excited to see you play for United?
‚ÄúI just want to say thanks for welcoming me to this amazing club, I can‚Äôt wait to see you and get started. I think it is an honour to represent this club and I can‚Äôt wait to engage with the fans. I have seen the support they give in every game. This club is known for winning trophies and I want to be a part of that, to win my first. I can see that the fan base is huge and they support the team through thick and thin. I am going to give everything for the club and for the fantastic fans and I can‚Äôt wait to get started.‚Äù",reddevils

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

Had the pleasure of my dream coming true and visiting old trafford for the first time ever after being a fan for 25 years.

No words can do justice to how amazing the feeling was. You lot who can visit week in and out are truely blessed.

Learned a ton about the history of our wonderful club that you just wouldn‚Äôt get from only Wikipedia or online.

Read about the Liverpool fixing scandal in 1915 which was very interesting. Also got some chills in the Munich corner (RIP you legends)

I can‚Äôt help but notice that the stadium seems like it‚Äôs in dire need of upgrades from the painting to the roofs. Also would it be possible to expand it towards the eastern side? I feel like that‚Äôs the only side the expansion would be plausible but maybe locals can chime in

Anyways this will probably get deleted but it was an incredible moment for me visiting the theater of dreams!",reddevils

400,400,400,Those who aren't Anti Glazer... Why? [Serious],"Morning / Afternoon / Evening all...

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a few discussions this past week or so on this sub, with several people supporting the Glazers and falling for main stream media was one phrase that was thrown at me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm personally anti-glazer. I don't think they're horrid people, I just think they're bad for the club, they came in and took loans against the club to finance a deal for us which left us with ¬£750m of debt and interests that compound with that.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore to that, they're more concerned of commercial deals and income to line their own pockets than keep United at the top (where I believe we belong). However in retaliation to this I often get people point out large sums paid for certain players, ie Pogba and now AWB. To which I think this is where people forget we have revenue numbers of close to \~¬£600m annually, I believe the money we spend on transfers in relation to revenue is closer to the bottom of the premier league table rather than the top. (Will search for source). On top of this, I think all transfers are made with sales in mind, or of high priority rather than purely footballing terms.

&amp;#x200B;

They also pay themselves in dividends of silly amounts for in my opinion doing next to nothing for the club.

&amp;#x200B;

But the reason I ask here as I have, I'm not in a blind rage about the Glazers, I have the figures on it I've researched myself and see very little positive footballing wise, (Commercially they've signed a genius in woodward and that shouldn't be forgotten.) But that for me is it, but if there are things I'm missing that people believe mean they're better than most of us give credit for, I genuinely would like to know.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit - Just wanted to make this absolutely clear, I don't want any of this to turn into some crappy slag match.

Edit 2 - Congrats everyone, lots of different opinions and no name calling.",reddevils
401,401,401,Preventing a couple of good players from leaving the club.,"Some people would be of the opinion as to allow the players to leave if they want to without considering factors such as the importance they've played in preventing the club from a total breakdown. The players in question are of course De Gea , Pogba and Lukaku. 

De Gea wants to leave because he has lost the belief that we want to compete to be one of the best in the world as we were before and also because of the pay disparities between him and Sanchez (please correct me if I'm wrong). He wants his salary to be in terms of what Sanchez receives and the reason behind this is that he's been the best player of the club for quite some time. Agreeing to his wage demands may seem unreasonable but I think the club does need to find a way or another to make him stay. The obvious reason being his World class performances otherwise which we would have been placed much lower on the table.
His boots will be extremely difficult to fill in a short time and personally it would be too much for me to take if both Herrera and De Gea left the club in the same window. Also not to mention that he has been a complete professional handling other stuffs (like his failed transfer to Real Madrid). He stay put and gave his best each time we stepped on the field.

As for Pogba we know that he's a World class talent and our former Academy player as well. He may want to make a move to Juventus or Real Madrid stating different reasons but one of the reasons could be that he too doesn't believe in the club given its current state. I was led to consider this opinion since he said that he wanted a 'new challenge' which doesn't make a lot of sense. And also the fact that he had more contribution that all the other players in all aspects of the game. Also he's very unlikely to leave because he's far too expensive for the suitors. So I guess his opinion could change in a season if we can produce some good football next season and qualify for the Champions league. After all he is one of our own(referring to the academy again)

As for Lukaku I don't have a lot of inputs. I admire the player, but the statement disrespecting our manager was just to much. And I guess his replacement will be easier to find that the other two who could be potentially replaced by maybe a new signing. Also I expect Rashford to improve which he will and Lukaku's transfer would also allow Greenwood more time on the pitch. I see it as a win - win situation.",reddevils

Full text follows:

\-----------------------

When charting the dizzying ascent of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, there really is only one place to begin. The day that altered a young Crystal Palace winger‚Äôs career path is well chronicled but worth recounting given how transformational it has proved.

A Thursday morning first-team training session in late 2016 and Kevin Keen, the then first-team coach, calls for a few under-23 players to make up the numbers. With the under-23 right back injured, Wan-Bissaka gets the call. Not only is the 18-year-old asked to play out of position, but he is set with the unenviable task of marking perhaps the Premier League‚Äôs most devastating winger, Wilfried Zaha.

Time and again, Zaha runs at the callow, makeshift right back, to no avail. ‚ÄúI can remember Wilf \[Zaha\] getting really frustrated,‚Äù Keen recalls. ‚ÄúLike you see in a Premier League game when he gets kicked, and he has a moan and gets the hump. He wasn‚Äôt used to a young boy coming over in training and not being able to get by him.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

The following week, Keen asked for Wan-Bissaka again. Andros Townsend, this time, was shackled impressively. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how he does it,‚Äù Zaha said. ‚ÄúYou may go past him, but he always manages to get a last ditch tackle in.‚Äù

Two and a half years and only 42 Premier League appearances later, Wan-Bissaka is on the verge of a ¬£50 million transfer to Manchester United, which will make the 21-year-old the most expensive defender in the club‚Äôs history. Subject to a medical, a five-year deal, which is worth about ¬£80,000 a week to the player, is likely to be wrapped up by the weekend.

‚ÄúIn the time I‚Äôve been in football,‚Äù Richard Shaw, the Palace under-23 manager, says, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen anyone go from learning a new position, to playing his first three games in the Premier League against Tottenham, Manchester United and Chelsea and coming through with flying colours, to playing his first full season, and being worth this amount of money. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to get your head around.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Wan-Bissaka grew up in New Addington, Croydon, a little over five miles from Selhurst Park. Like many of the talented young players who have emerged from south London in recent years, his skills were honed in cage matches with friends, or on Walton Green, the sloping grass park near his house, where he played with his older brother, Kevin, and children from his estate.

Aged six, Wan-Bissaka had joined Junior Elite, the grassroots youth club Kevin also played for. ‚ÄúHe was a centre forward with us,‚Äù Colin Omogbehin, the club‚Äôs founder, says. ‚ÄúHe had a lot of natural talent, he was top scorer every year. But having said that, he was always willing to work hard. And very humble. Quiet. Shy, almost. But he came alive on the football field, and took no prisoners.‚Äù

It was Omogbehin, who was a coach in Palace‚Äôs academy and now works for Fulham, who advised the Eagles to sign Wan-Bissaka, aged eleven. Doubts about his attitude and application surfaced on a number of occasions and at 14 it took an intervention from his father, Ambrose, to remind him of the need to avoid distractions and bad influences.

&amp;#x200B;

On a couple of occasions, Shaw recalls, Wan-Bissaka failed to show, or turned up late, for games or training. ‚ÄúHe had a few issues,‚Äù Shaw says. ‚ÄúThere were times where he was influenced by other guys. He was in a boisterous group. They weren‚Äôt shy, as you can imagine, coming from south London. And they were close friends. He went to school with them all. It was hard work. People said, ‚ÄòMaybe we need to move him on ‚Ä¶‚Äô But we persevered. I knew that one day things would click, and he‚Äôd get it. And by God, he got it.‚Äù

In 2016, Shaun Derry, the former Palace midfielder and then the manager of Cambridge United, piloted a scheme where Palace‚Äôs academy prospects were invited to train with the Sky Bet League Two club to experience the realities of life outside the Premier League, with a view to a possible loan move. Wan-Bissaka and Noor Husin, now at Notts County, were the first to do so.

‚ÄúThe idea was for them to see a League Two facility: the food, the gym, one training kit you have to take home and wash at night,‚Äù Derry, who also coached a 14-year-old Wan-Bissaka in Palace‚Äôs academy, says. ‚ÄúIt was taking them out of the comfort zone of Premier League life. At that moment, Aaron wasn‚Äôt ready to leave London and come to Cambridge, where we were fighting for our lives.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

There were bumps on the road to becoming Europe‚Äôs most resolute defender, too. Shaw recalls the first time Wan-Bissaka played at right back for Palace‚Äôs under-23s. ‚ÄúIt was a 2-2 draw against Charlton \[Athletic\],‚Äù Shaw says. ‚ÄúHe struggled at times, positioning-wise. One of the goals was his fault because the ball got played inside him. But we just kept persevering with him.

‚ÄúWe knew he had those, what we call, ‚ÄòGo-go gadget legs‚Äô. When he had played as a winger he always tracked back and was very good defensively. The big thing for us was his defensive positioning. He‚Äôs got the ability going forward ‚Äî people have not seen the best of him yet.

‚ÄúBut the main thing is ‚Äî and I‚Äôve heard people saying, ‚ÄòI knew Aaron was going to be a player since he was two years old, in nappies‚Äô, I don‚Äôt buy all that ‚Äî Aaron has helped Aaron. Dave \[Reddington, the Palace first-team coach\] and I have helped him along the way. But he embraced it. If we said, ‚ÄòAaron, we‚Äôre going outside \[to do some extra work\] at two o‚Äôclock‚Äô, he said ‚ÄòYeah‚Äô. Didn‚Äôt even question it.

&amp;#x200B;

A month before his debut against Tottenham Hotspur in February 2018, thanks to a first-team injury crisis, Wan-Bissaka had spoken with Roy Hodgson, the Palace manager, about going on loan to a League Two club. Hodgson told Wan-Bissaka he was part of his plans but only 18 months on, he must now plan for life without him.

Shaw insists that Wan-Bissaka is equipped for a career at Old Trafford. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a guy who just gets on with life,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAfter every game I text him to say, ‚ÄòWell done, keep working hard.‚Äô He always says, ‚ÄòYep, I will‚Äô. Whoever he‚Äôs playing for, I‚Äôll say the same. That‚Äôs what got him here.

‚ÄúIf Aaron goes to Manchester United, a World Cup, anywhere, he won‚Äôt change.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll take everything in his stride.‚Äù

420,420,420,"In the post-Fergie era, who is the signing you are glad we missed out on?","Just off the top of my head, with hindsight being 20/20 I am glad we whiffed on the following:

Perisic: This saga is one we have discussed often, especially as Inter has come looking for Lukaku. Inter tried to dick us around, we put our foot down and rejected Mou's desire to bring him in. Worked out for us. An older player coming off a solid World Cup, but nothing spectacular, especially at the price. Could have been a very regretful signing for us.

Morata: Even though Lukaku hasn't really panned for us, it is not hard to believe that we made out better than Chelsea in this saga. The red haired devil from Madrid looked certain to sign for us, and would solve our crisis up top. Looking back, it is very doubtful he would have. Playing within a superior Chelsea squad, he couldn't get it done. How would he have fared within this mess?

Leon Bailey: I was super excited about this potential transfer. Thought he was a future world class winger and could have solved our huge hole on the right side. It now looks like I was ***very wrong.*** The press speculated a big money move could be coming from us in the winter of 2017-18 and the summer of 2018, with Arsenal and other clubs looking at him too, as he had a strong 2017-2018 season for Leverkusen, Bailey never elevated his game this season and honestly regressed.",reddevils

435,435,435,"ICYMI: A complete Manchester United-focused summary of tonight's BBC 5 Live Sport transfer show, featuring David Ornstein + Statman Dave","For those who are unaware and perhaps intrigued by some of the quotes that have just started doing the rounds online, from 20:00 - 21:30PM UK time tonight, BBC Radio 5 had their Live Sport Transfer discussion show, and Manchester United were a prominent topic of discussion for the panel, which featured Charlie Adam, BBC's David Ornstein, the Telegraph's Sam Wallace and our very own Statman Dave. I thought I would provide a quick summary of the key points for anyone who missed out and doesn't want to dig through an hour and a half of the transfer thread, so here goes:

----------------------------------


- The initial topic of discussion, as I'm sure you're all aware of by now, is that Aaron Wan-Bissaka is expected to become a Manchester United player imminently, now that we've agreed on a transfer fee valuation of ¬£45 million + ¬£5 million in bonuses with Crystal Palace. Ornstein once again confirmed that AWB flew into Manchester today by private jet (congratulations to the resident muppets of r/reddevils who successfully tracked the right flight). The announcement of a 5-year deal is expected to take place tomorrow following a medical.

- In more interesting news, the next United piece of discussion turned to our search for a new centre-half, with Ornstein and the panel confirming it to be a priority signing this summer. Two key pieces of information relating to this CB search followed:

- The first is Tier 1 confirmation from David Ornstein that Manchester United were not only one of the clubs interested in signing Matthijs De Ligt, but the *only* club to have tabled a ""serious contract offer"" to the Dutchman at the time of his last update from sources. However, Ornstein also followed up by stating that De Ligt rejected this same offer. One thing that hasn't been mentioned in some of partial quotes floating around on the internet is that Ornstein said he expects this situation will change over time, which could mean that we submit a new offer or that rival clubs come through with their own deals. As far as I'm aware, this is the first time a British Tier 1 source has confirmed our interest and bid for De Ligt. (u/seaders has kindly provided me with the actual audio for this section, you can listen here: https://streamable.com/43ko0)

- Another centre-half who is confirmed to be a clear target for us is Leicester's Harry Maguire. Ornstein explained that the Englishman is involved in a straight fight between Manchester City and Manchester United, but crucially also stressed that Leicester are not desperate to sell Maguire, and would only do so if their valuation of ¬£75 million was met. Ornstein implied that both City and United are reluctant to meet this valuation, and neither club has submitted an offer near this amount yet.

- The Telegraph's Sam Wallace says that we are making a move for Lyon's 15-year old wonderkid striker Rayan Cherki. This is presumably another attempt by Nicky Butt to substantially strengthen our academy.

- Statman Dave mentioned that we were one of the clubs interested in Tanguy Ndombele, but that he will be going to Spurs this summer.

- Amidst rumours of Liverpool being interested in our target Bruno Fernandes, David Ornstein crucially mentioned that the Scousers will be having a ""low-key"" summer this year, with no intention to splash big money on names such as Lille's Nicolas Pepe or Lyon's Nabil Fekir. If this information is true, it sounds like we have a free run at Bruno.

- Kalidou Koulibaly is of interest to both Manchester United and City. However, Statman Dave and Ornstein stated that Napoli don't have an intention to sell him this summer. The signing of Manolas does NOT change this, with the two seen as the first-choice centre-back pairing for the Italians this upcoming season.

- Finally, David Ornstein tantalisingly concluded the programme by telling viewers to keep an eye on Sampdoria CB Joachim Andersen, as it is expected that he'll be making a move to the Premier League this summer. Andersen was linked with us last summer, and given our search for a CB it's possible that we'll be in for him again. This update concluded the show.

470,470,470,"An explanation of transfer fees, instalments and player amortisation","Some bloke posted a shit article that didn‚Äôt understand basic accounting and I spent 10 minutes typing this response on mobile. There are far too many articles out there from shite sources that don‚Äôt even understand the concept of an asset.

Hopefully this isn‚Äôt a complete bore but if it is then, well... you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôre not an accountant...

A players fee is almost always paid in instalments but the instalments don‚Äôt really matter from an accounting point of view because all clubs will use accrual accounting. The instalments matter from a cashflow perspective only.

From an accounting point of view, when a club buys a player it‚Äôs basic ledger entries. Let‚Äôs make up an example: we buy Pogba for ¬£90m, tie him to a 5 year contract and the instalments are ¬£40m up front and ¬£25m a year for two more years. When the purchase happens the following occurs:

‚Äò-¬£40m Cash (Upfront instalment)

+¬£90m Asset (Pogba‚Äôs cost to us (accounting principles state an asset should be the lower of cost or net realisable value)

+¬£50m Liability (the remaining instalments we owe)

When the next year rolls around and the next instalment is paid:

‚Äò-¬£25m Cash

-¬£25m Liability

The same occurs for the final ¬£25m instalment.

Those entries deal with all the cashflows and anticipated cashflows.

Now here‚Äôs the part that no article can seem to get right. Amortisation of a players value over the life of their contract...

Pogba is an asset to us and his value is initially at cost. However, he has a contract with us and, if he chooses not to renew, can leave for free at the end of his contract. As a result, we need to follow the principles of accounting that state that we have to amortise his value straight line for each year of his contract to account for this ‚Äúloss of value‚Äù as we move closer to the expiration of his contract.

So on OUR balance sheet, after one year, he will be worth ¬£72m to us (¬£90m / 5 years = ¬£18m reduction in value). Whilst this is a non-cash entry it‚Äôs really quite important as the ¬£18m reduction on our balance sheet affects our bottom line. This is amortisation in a nutshell. It‚Äôs the equivalent of depreciation but for intangible/financial assets.",reddevils

Below I have listed every incoming transfer after SAF retired and the date that each transfer was announced.  

Before we get to the list a couple of notes:  

1) You will notice that Mata, Vald√©s and Sanchez are not included on the list due to the fact they were signed during January transfer windows.  

2) Since Fergie retired we have completed 22 transfers, only 5 of which were announced at this point in the transfer window (25th June).  

3) This data is not completely applicable to this transfer window due to the fact most of the transfers on the list were completed when the English transfer window ended at the end of August instead of the current deadline on the 9th of August.  

Remember it‚Äôs the hope that kills you. Here is the list - 


7th May - Memphis Depay  
7th June - Varela

Share it here and here alone. The transfer daily threads will now be for Journalists only.

Note: this is the wild west. We aren't policing a thing here, believe who you believe at your own risk. Reddit and subreddit rules about general behaviour do apply though.

**********

We specifically are light-handed on moderating in this thread because the idea is so we can have a bit of fun. Folks can post almost anything they want and you can go full muppet about the newest social media post someone has liked.

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

Have fun doing what you're doing, and discuss the anonymous ITKs legitimacy all you want, but targeting individuals, and/or haranguing / harassing members of our subreddit is a no-no.

********

""Turf wars"" are not cool. We keep two separate threads (Muppet Thread + Transfer Thread) so everyone has somewhere to go and discuss transfers.

We do **NOT** want to see division within our community about ""look at the nerds in the nerd thread"" or ""look at the idiots in the dummy thread"".

We will be cracking down on this kind of stuff as it just creates division within the community. We understand that a lot of it is intended to be harmless joking but it always starts to spiral out of control

492,492,492,The Glazers,"To preface, I understand that this is going to be heavily down-voted so it doesn't really affect me.  


I'm here to tell you why the Glazer's **aren't** actually bad owners of Manchester United.  


There seems to be a bandwagon, tribal, outrage culture surrounding 'the Glazers' and how we want #Glazersout. In fact, the recent trends indicate that the Glazers must be committing heinous crimes against football/humanity/your life.

  
They aren't.  


Using statista, and an update of the current revenue from Man Utd, it can be noted that Manchester United have generated around ¬£6.5B in revenue in the last 10 years, and since the glazers arrived, around ¬£7B in Revenue.  


There is a graph floating around talking about how the Glazers are siphoning money into their own debt. It labels 'reported net debt' and shows a figure of around ¬£500m - this is not the same sort of debt as say if you went over in overdraft or if you overspent - this is business debt.   


What can be noted, is that Manchester United is the largest business club in football. I.e. There are other teams, most notably Wolves, PSG and Manchester City that have ownership injections of money. This is fundamentally *bad* for the football economy - this is the sort of thing that puts the prices of players from max ¬£80m to 300+ in a short space of time.  


Manchester United is run a little bit differently. They generate their own revenue and feed that back into the club. Now, the consensus seems to be that the Glazers are taking money from the club and not investing much back in; they have invested net ¬£666m (the devil's number) back into the club; this is not gross spend (total spend without sales)

&amp;#x200B;

So, Manchester United is run like a business. The Glazers are running Manchester United like a business...in football this shouldn't be considered a bad thing. There seems to be a glorification of sugar daddies in football, as if it would solve life's problems.  


'Why can't we spend ¬£75m on Maguire and just leave it?'

Well, that is relative to the market yes, this isn't something we were saying even 5 years ago. ¬£75m would have been the third most valuable player ever.  


Sugar Daddies are what is fundamentally *wrong* with football. Just pumping money into the economy, as people know, causes massive inflation. If you make more money, your money is worth less. So, in order for the Glazers to keep up, they have to borrow. This is where the debt is in play. This debt is more like a mortgage. It's there, it's not intrusive and putting money from your business to pay the business debt to retain assent leverage is *not* a bad thing.  


It seems very much that people are scaremongering, bandwagoning to get the Glazer's out because they think they should 'just spend the money' to keep up, in an already fragile market. This is a poor business decision, it would not only affect the club but also the entire football economy. If you have 6 huge spenders every year and it gets more and more and more each passing season, it's going to cause a market crash, where the value of players goes down. Suddenly, the only teams staying afloat are the Sugar daddy teams like PSG, City, Wolves etc - it's a very bad event waiting to happen.  


Yes we want the Glazers to invest, and so far, going all guns blazing and splashing 175m+ on players is a little absurd to just accept as a rightful thing.  


A football club the size of united is not some strange vanity project, it's a functioning business.

511,511,511,I'm hoping to go to my first ever match at OT,"Hey guys,

I live in Australia and will be making my first trip to the UK in August for a mates wedding just outside of London.

We're in London from the 9th until the 19th of August and it just so happens that the opening match against Chelsea at OT is on the 11th! A livelong dream can be fulfilled!

So, what I wanted to ask some of you more experienced lads is how I'm best to go about this?

I've just signed up as a United Member which from my understanding gives me the options to buy tickets right from the club itself once they go on sale - however, I've got 3 mates who are coming so we'll need 4 tickets.

I've also found this website:  [https://www.thomascooksport.com/event/Manchester-United-v-Chelsea/15276](https://www.thomascooksport.com/event/Manchester-United-v-Chelsea/15276) and they seem to do a pretty well priced match ticket + accommodation package for all of us. Is this sort of website worth using or are they a ripoff?

Also, I need to do an OT tour while I'm there, so I'm thinking the Monday morning after the match would be best as we won't get in to Manchester until the Sunday morning after the bucks party in Edinburgh the night before.

532,532,532,How Ronaldo played and was before all his extraordinary goal achievements,"For the last few years he became a severe goal scorer and his game play changed as a result, but i came across videos of him when he was still ""that"" player that gave us that excitement that unkown part of his play this is just a personal view which im sure will be shared by millions and it brought back so many memories of genius that we have missed since 2009 imo,i won't really go into his superb goal record as its always talked of but instead the part many forget or simply dont know. Ill try and keep it short but this is Ronaldo so will be difficult. 

Im almost 31 and i remember when we signed him, and straight away we all like so like the knock off Brazilian Ronaldo? Good luck, his first few years he was this show boat player with no end product but brought excitement to us, had briliant skills that often failed, brilliant dribbling, but lacked the final third, didn't realy score alot but we didn't know what was to come, he was very unpredictable but effective as he would cause problems. But all this made all fans jump from seats be it home or at grounds, his step overs, his cut backs, his sprint speed, his first touch was like second nature even at 18 odd he didnt even think about it as he knew it was good compared to say lukaku, his frustrations when he failed was because he knew he, we knew he was capable of so much more, but not once did he collapse and give up he kept trying and trying till he done right, but still made us happy watching him play because it was fun, all the cheers from crowds of a simple flick, run, step over, cut back, back heel etc. One of his first call ups to Portugal he lost ball in opposition box but ran all way back to win ball but concedes penalty showed his hunger and desire to win, game vs millwall fa cup final which he scored in but he played well with tricks and flicks where Dennis wise fouls him, wise spits on his own hand and puts on Ronaldos face! Did Ronaldo moan? Yes, did he give up? Hell no. 

For me the turning point was rooney vs Ronaldo and the red card, following season he changed, he had bulked up alot, mentality changed and its like he went up levels, his dribbling was effective, started making passes, became stronger, more aware, the boos from other fans actually made him better, then he became the main man, before he went missing in key games, but at 23 or so he turned up, we were in a way being run by a guy at 23 /24 who we knew could do something to step up and outshine anyone.

2006/07 season till 09 imo he was unplayable, no one came near him, he became the go to guy for utd, this is where the goals started coming in, he became effective, match winning, so many memories, the run and goal vs fulham, pompey free-kick, arsenal free-kick/rooney Ronaldo counter, pompey long range, so many key games where he didnt even score. 

07/08 we win title and champions league, he was this monster who coudnt be stopped, goals went up severely at 42, scored 2 goals a game for 3 games running, and this wasn't even his peak, he was the best in the world here, messi wasnt compared to him then, utd fans were mesmerized by this talent by now Brazilian Ronaldo wasnt compared to him either, we relied on him hugely here, that briliant goal vs porto, the header vs Roma, granted we had such a good team then but still Ronaldo stood out. 

Moves to real madrid where we all know what happend, but the years before this was imo his fun years that brought us so much joy to fans that we haven't had since he left, i feel as a fan i watched him from this kid who had talent but needed that guidance and for me, fergie was so crucial to his development, that maybe just maybe he woudnt of been this Ronaldo without fergie? From a kid at 18 to 34 we all been there we all watched him transform to a beast of a player who seems to me takes everything serious when it comes to being the best possible, he worked to become the best and to be one of 2 best for over 10 yrs is something i won't see in my lifetime i also believe messi and Ronaldo needed eachother to push otherwise there is no one else to keep them on their toes. 
 
Two reasons i wanted to write this 1 the old vidoes, 2 my nephew's always say Ronaldo the goal scorer and any skills moves are associated with neymar etc many younger fans wont remember or know the Ronaldo before his goals but that's the Ronaldo i always remember, the joy, excitement and so on for me, he worked to be the best and broke so many records along the way that im glad i seen him all the way, i assume retirement is on cards soon? But in 20 years or more ill talk of him and say i remember it all, i was there he was the best player i seen, the consistency is unheard of from say 21 till now he turns up most players peaked for few years he got better and better and im certain won't see another like him while im still alive, he also turned up for his national team where in game vs Sweden for the play off for world cup he got an applaud from zlatan which says it all, or vs Spain in world cup, how many times have we said it about him thats why for me the greatest player i ever seen. 

I have few videos which ill share, no music just pure commentary to remember it all. As long as least 1 fan remembers just like me it will be worth it. Iv kept it short as possible otherwise this would turn into a book.

534,534,534,Should Angel Gomez get a loan after Mata's contract extension?,"I don't get to watch much of the academy but I understand that Gomez is a player of the same qualities that Mata, not only from the physical aspect but also in the technical qualities and playmaking/creation as a number 10 player.

Angel didn't get a lot of times the past 2 seasons and seen Juan would be with us for at least 2 more years maybe is the right time for him to get a loan and start having more playing time under his belt and when the times come to play regularly he isn't just an academy prospect.

I don't think that a bottom table club would suit him, since most play very defensive, and probably a dominant team in the Championship would be better for his development

What are your thoughts on this?

EDIT: I don't think that in the end Ole is gonna rotate the team that much between all 4 competitions and that the youngsters won't going to play in one or two of those tournaments as starters. If we don't sell players and bring 3 to 4 (rumored) more then the first team squad is going to have a lot of players in quantity

Having said that we did have a purple patch during the start of Ole's reign and were clearly the best team in the premier league for about 10-12 games.

So even if we cannot replace all the holes during this window we can expect a few players to step up (Mctominay showed great potential, hopefully Fred settles down and the youngsters will always be hungry to perform). A long shot but maybe even Axel could try to cement his centre back spot.

If this does work out the team could easily qualify for the Champions league even if they don't perform well at the transfer market.",reddevils

Positives 
- Great link up play
- Good through balls
- Good off ball movement
- Good instinct and movement inside the box
- Retained possession well
- Good at winning fouls

Negatives 
- No successful crosses
- All long shots have been off target
- No successful dribbles
- Inconsistent first touch
- Tendency to pass to teammates in bad positions
- Cannot maintain high intensity play for long periods
- Deteriorates physically in second half 

Comments:
It would seem from the first two games that Sanchez has struggled to find himself in positions out wide, he has shown a complete unwillingness to engage with athletic defenders on the dribble opting to retain possession instead. Sanchez is also struggling to take the ball in tight spaces and performs much better when he has 5 yards to settle on the ball. Has performed much better when receiving the ball in the center areas of the pitch where he has quickly tried to engage his striker with a through ball or link up play. Sanchez has also looked good as a secondary option in the box when receiving crosses and has favoured a late run off of the fullback.",reddevils

So as you can see, United can sign a player from nothing. It all happens pretty quickly, and it can all go silent for a few days such as Matic. So please do not fret. Our Tier 1s rarely break news, it's usually other team's/country's

Heard something from your butcher?

Dave from Marketing got loose lips after his second WKD blue?

Share it here and here alone. The transfer daily threads will now be for Journalists only.

Note: this is the wild west. We aren't policing a thing here, believe who you believe at your own risk. Reddit and subreddit rules about general behaviour do apply though.

**********

We specifically are light-handed on moderating in this thread because the idea is so we can have a bit of fun. Folks can post almost anything they want and you can go full muppet about the newest social media post someone has liked.

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

Have fun doing what you're doing, and discuss the anonymous ITKs legitimacy all you want, but targeting individuals, and/or haranguing / harassing members of our subreddit is a no-no.

""Turf wars"" are not cool. We keep two separate threads (Muppet Thread + Transfer Thread) so everyone has somewhere to go and discuss transfers.

The two clubs had finally struck a deal over a ‚Ç¨75m fee, but De Ligt is now said to be choosing between PSG,¬†‚ÄãJuventus¬†and¬†‚ÄãBayern Munich, who have all presented huge offers to the 19-year-old this summer.",reddevils

655,655,655,Back The Policy,"Not a lot of positivity surrounding Man Utd at the moment so I wanted to raise a point on our season ahead and transfer targets which I‚Äôm happy to see.

Now obviously it‚Äôs gutting being in the Europa League but what it does mean is 10+ Guaranteed games vs relatively easy European opposition. It also sets the expectation lower on those European nights and actually takes more pressure off of achieving top 4 through the league as you can qualify by winning it.

It provides a great basis if used correctly to bed in the young talent currently at Man Utd. It also finally gives us a chance to take a risk on signing 18-23 year olds with potential high upsides. 

Daniel James is a great illustration of that, I don‚Äôt expect much from him in the league this season but this year the Europa league should set him up perfectly to be a first team player next year. I also see the same opportunity for Dalot to get some regularity playing in that RB position. If AWB signs then we have another young player who will get similar exposure to what he had at Palace and not PSG/Juve/Barca, which will be great for his development.

I would like to see us chase after a few more of these players, people like; Gon√ßalo Guedes, Ismaila Sarr, Donny Van de Beek, Declan Rice &amp;amp; Leon Bailey. 

It is kind of key to chase these players now as if we do qualify for CL next year the opportunity will be missed to bed these players in with much more ease.

The opportunity this year is also perfect for McTominay, Chong, Gomes, Greenwood, TFM, Tuanzebe &amp; Pereira as these guys will have games that they can feature in and games where the coaching staff can risk playing them.

Finally it is slightly controversial but I would not mind taking a view this year on the Carabao &amp;amp; FA cup and really use it this season as a platform for growing the youth as well. If we do that along side the Europa I could see us giving the likes of TFM &amp;amp; Chong 10-15 appearances this year. Which would be vital for 2020-21 in which a step up to the next level would be expected.",reddevils

&amp;#x200B;

I'm almost sure that someone else might done have a comparison like this with greater accuracy and/or more detail.

* The seasons compared are the last Ronaldo one, the last SAF one, and everything since then. The last season was not separated into Mourinho/Ole eras.
* I only included aspects which are directly comparable, with the notable exception being transfers in/out. As these often included youth or reserve players.
* I wanted to include injuries per season, and total days lost. But there wasn't any reliable source for a full breakdown.
* I did not include the top assister, as I really did not want to count goals individually for every season.
* Stats do not tell the whole story, but I found it interesting to look at what is there.
* You'll notice that I didn't highlight certain cells, because the story isn't as clear cut. For example, our record in the 08/09 CL campaign was 6-6-1 on the way to a Final. In the 18/19 season, it was 4-1-5 which ended in a Quarter-Final. I could have segregated the matches into group stages and knock-outs, but I simplified it. For now, at least.
* Speaking of CL, any season where we did not participate was labeled the worst. Arrogant? Perhaps. But I have high standards for our team.
* Compiling this took a bit of effort. I assume that there is a whole stat pack available if you cough up the cash. The sources used were the Premier League's official site, WhoScored, and Wikipedia. One or two of these may be prone to errors, but I wasn't looking for an exact science and I am not getting paid for this.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the comparison is far from perfect (I did do stats in my previous job). If the Reddit community likes it, I can proceed to do all the other seasons including our time as Newton Heath. These would probably be in separate tabs by decade. And a special tab comparing teams from different eras. Assuming something like that doesn't already exist.

The only reason David de gea is still at this club is because of a broken fax machine. Ronaldo began engineering his move to real three years before his left. Rooney threatened to go to city. If you want to keep the best players in the world the ambition of the club has to match and it hasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs football, it happens. Swallow the pride,  act like a big club and hold onto him, build a successful future and a lot of things can change in a year. Selling every player who flirts with a move is weak and we have too much deadwood to be focusing on selling one of our only world class talents. Can‚Äôt expect to have world class players want to stay and waste their prime years if the club doesn‚Äôt respect itself enough to invest in a future and structure that is required to be a big club. Real have one down season after here champions leagues and drop 300 mill before July  because they mean business while we can‚Äôt figure out what structure we want as a club. Build it and they will come, and as a club we have built nothing worth coming to. We need to question our hierarchy not the only player we had that made team of the year.
 
This is also the short sided mindset that resulted in us selling players like Memphis and Zaha due to ‚Äúmentality‚Äù only to see them succeed in clubs with an established culture and philosophy. At some point people need to realize it‚Äôs not them; maybe it‚Äôs the club. Too many good players under perform in our badge for us not to question the environment at the club. Juventus, Madrid, Barca, bayern, and all the clubs of our magnitude don‚Äôt struggle with this issue and there‚Äôs a reason for that. It‚Äôs time we hold the people running this club to a higher standard. We need to focus on the root of the problem rather than treating the symptoms.

724,724,724,Discussion: The pace of our transfers,"I see a lot of frustration on this sub (and wider fanbase) regarding how slow our transfer dealings seem to be moving. Full disclosure I actually started writing a reply to a comment in the daily transfer thread, but word-splurged over many topics. So instead of this being buried I'd like to see other reds views on this, in the spirit of reasoned discussions on this sub vs mindless sniping at one another. 

**Other Club's Transfer Success**

Fans are looking at clubs like Real Madrid and Dortmund and asking how they're able to complete their business so efficiently, whereas we are taking forever. People often mention the ""United Tax"" as a hold-up but IMO we have a different ""United tax"" now because we don't have the same pulling power as RM. They're basically guaranteed a CL finish every year regardless of instability and are consistently competing for silverware. It was no secret Hazard wanted to sign for them for ages, and that makes the transfer a lot simpler. RM/Barca have always had the allure as long as I remember and that hasn't changed. Small side point - they've had 6 garbage transfer windows according to their fans, and this summer spree was LONG on the cards. To the point where reporters have said other clubs are waiting for the chain reaction in transfers from Real conducting their business, because signings like Hazard were nailed on for ages.

For United, it's a different situation. Back at the height of our powers under SAF, aside from being hamstrung by the Glazers, SAF was able to get in the players he wanted, without having to try and ""sell a project"" to potential targets. Now, there's massive instability and players (read: wages) need convincing of coming here, over any other top club - and we've seen that clearly with the decimation of our wage structure since SAF left. 

**Player Power**

This also leads to player power and the clusterfuck that is dealing with high powered agents and modern negotiation tactics. Look at players like MLD and Greizz who are able to tease bullshit in the media for months and drag out their decision making - even Barca are falling trap this, so it's definitely a reality for us. Was it Anders or Mata we signed through some hidden broker type people who negotiated on our behalf to get the deal done? From what I've read something similar is happening with Bruno Fernandes. According to reports, other players we're linked with like Rabiot and Tielemans are shopping around for clubs too - they have many offers on the table and we're just one of the pack - again slowing down negotiations.  

**Broadcasting Money**

Then there's the amount of money in the game. With how lucrative TV deals have gotten, quality players are the commodity for clubs, not cash. This is why we see teams like Palace holding out for 50m+ for AWB because what motivation do they have to sell? They know they have one of the most talented players in the league in that position and it's their right to make the transfer as workable for them as possible. Just like it is for us with the potential sale of Pogba/Lukaku etc (i.e. we should absolutely be holding out for top money for them, otherwise fuck off, they stay).

I understand teams like Dortmund have gotten signings across the line quickly - but ask yourself are they players that suit the level Dortmund are looking for (ability, price etc) - and that's why they were able to get them? Or were they going after the best players in the European leagues like we are? They have stability, a defined transfer strategy and a relatively consistent level of club. I'm not so sure it's comparable; I don't think we can be compared to either Dortmund or RM. Look across at the transfer business of the PL top 6 - who else has made so many signings, let alone major ones? Besides Pool and City, everyone else needs a lot of work just like we do.  

**Media**

Last point on this ramble is the media. Times have changed with every single tiny development in a transfer being blown up and spread across the world in seconds, without any thought to the complexity of negotiations, especially in a tough market situation as now (see points above). There's so many reasons for transfers to be slowed, so many factors impacting decisions that making quick deals for the players we REALLY are no longer quick deals. 

Should we just pay what clubs are asking? I get that view and agree somewhat - especially when it kills me how the pigfucker Glazers are siphoning money out of our United, when we should/could use those interest payments to meet asking prices and get deals done. Conversely, where does it end? Today we pay the ¬£75m asking price for AWB because that's what we desperately need now, but how will that impact our next signing, and the one after, and the one after that? Clubs know we'll just pay the asking price, so lets up that United tax some more! No matter what state the business is in, is that sustainable long term? As armchair fans and keyboard warriors it's easy to say so. EDIT: Not to mention the media pressure of ""¬£50mil down the drain"", for every player we overpay for that doesn't perform.

Having said all that, I'm feeling just as impatient and wish we could get these fucking transfers over the line yesterday, because the insane pace of media updates vs the actual reality of real life make these things feel like they've dragged on FOREVER already. Could Ed/Judge etc do better? Fuck yeah, but I don't think that's the only factor at play. Am I chatting shit? Probably. It's easy to overlook points to fit your narrative so please change my mind! Fingers crossed, OGS gets what he needs, to at least have a good crack next season. And then, is given TIME and CONSISTENT BACKING with the proper vision and philosophy, just like Klopp/Pep.

**TLDR Top talent is scarce and money is everywhere. We're not as appealing as we were in the past, and negotiations with rich clubs, agents and players are ever more complex. Our transfer policy/long term strategy is still unresolved and the glazers are parasites.**",reddevils
725,725,725,"An analysis on the 4-4-2 diamond, our transfer dealings and next season.","Looking at our summer activity, I think we can assume that Ole will be looking to adopt a system that is very similar to the one Liverpool played this past season: a 4-4-2 diamond. Although Liverpool's system looks like a 4-3-3 on paper, Firmino drops so deep that it actually functions as a 4-4-2 diamond, with Salah and Mane playing as split strikers who become wingers without the ball. Their system has a few characteristics: high intensity, a high line of engagement, a high line of defense and a very hard working midfield that cover a lot of ground.

Of course, I am not recommending we copy their system like-for-like; we are stronger in some areas and weaker in many others. Our system should be similar in philosophy but different in approach. Below I will list a few key aspects that we must focus on when comparing ourselves to Liverpool.

**1) Strikers must be comfortable out wide**

The real strikers in Liverpool‚Äôs formation are Salah and mane. They are both comfortable out wide and making runs in behind. I think we are somewhat decent in this aspect with martial, Jesse, Rashford, Lukaku and maybe **James**. They must also press well and work hard off the ball

**Resolution**: Martial and Lukaku have to improve on their movement and their work rate The attackers as a whole need a better end product. Jesse and Rashford are basically perfect to play this system and it will play to their strengths. Hopefully, we bring in Sancho but it is not the end of the world if we don't (should we play this system).

**2) Attacking fullbacks, and Trent Alexander Arnold.**

We all know how good Roberson and TAA are in attack. Both have good energy and crossing ability. In comparison, young has been fucking shite going forward and Shaw has been average. We will really need to improve in this aspect and signing AWB is a good start. I don‚Äôt buy AWB‚Äôs supposedly weakness in attack because every fullback will look shite going forward in that palace team. 

I would like to highlight TAA‚Äôs contribution to this Liverpool team. He has a fantastic cross, probably one of the best in the entire league. But what is less talked about is his ability to playmaker. He has the vision and passing ability to basically become a playmaker from the fullback position. It also means he is good both out wide and slightly tucked in towards the middle. He is basically Pep‚Äôs wet dream and is a huge reason why Liverpool can afford to play the midfield they play and still not look toothless. TAA actually missed three matches during that period where they dropped points: Leicester, west ham and Everton. And also the 3-0 defeat at the Camp Nou.

**Resolution**: Shaw and **AWB** need to provide high energy, providing a threat in the final third. Shaw had a decent season but looked really toothless going forward, this needs to be addressed this season. AWB is a former winger and hopefully will get the license to push forward. Dalot will be fantastic in this role against smaller teams.

Of course, we don't expect TAA's level of playmaking from our fullbacks, we have creativity in midfield that they don't: Paul Pogba.


**3) Pressing and the defensive trident**

If you watched the UCL final, Klopp actually completely neutralised Spurs' buildup play with a very different kind of pressing game we have seen from them in the past. They gave Lloris, Alderweireld, and Vertonghen all the time in the world with the ball and pressed their out ball instead. Mane and Salah were constantly on their fullbacks, Firmino in between the defence and midfield lines, Henderson, Gini and Fabinho on the midfield three of Sissoko, Winks, and Eriksen. This resulted in the entire Spurs team being extremely disconnected. Winks, Sissoko and Eriksen were never in the game. The center-backs simply were not given the chance to find them in a good position at all and had to resort to hoofing it forward.

But that's where the Liverpool defensive trident (Fabinho, Van Dijk and Matip) came up absolutely huge. All three are very very good at winning 1v1 duels, both on the ground and in the air. Van Dijk and Matip both came out of the defensive line to win a ball if needed. This meant that Kane never had a chance to hold up the ball to bring someone else into play. This meant that there was a large area of the pitch (the midfield and the line between midfield and defence) where Spurs could not even compete. Poch realised this and started getting trippier and rose on the ball. Their best phases of play all came from either Rose running down the left flank or Trippier hoofing the ball in behind the defensive for Kane, Son, and Alli to run onto. The speed and positioning of Van Dijk and Allison coming off his line meant that this was only semi-successful. Matip and Van Dijk both recover extremely well even when they lose duels, and this meant that their defensive shape never suffered.

**Resolution**: Ole has a huge job to do, drilling a structured and high-intensity press. The work ethic of the entire team also comes into question. Will Martial and Lukaku work as hard as Salah and Mane? We are losing one of our hardest workers in Herrera and work rate in midfield has been a problem for a long time. I believe that Pogba is not lazy and is someone who is highly influenced by those around him (watch him play beside Kante for France). Pogba is absolutely crucial to our team and we should not let him go at any price. He is our best player and our most creative player. Our midfield will be extremely important due to how 'limited' our fullbacks are compared to Liverpool. Hence, we need to sign and field players who work hard, have high energy and also the ability to bring the ball forward. 

**Rabiot** works hard and does well in defense. He is also a great ball carrier and has good passing ability. N'dombele and Lo Celso in comparison, are both slightly more suspect in defensive situations.
**Fernandes** has the technical and playmaking ability to take some of the burden off Pogba. He also works hard and presses well - the closest to Firmino we cant get. Play Fred and McTominay in the pivot instead of Matic. Matic is far too slow and has been very poor on the ball. Jesse will also be decent in the Firmino position.

We also need a defender who is comfortable breaking out the defensive line to win a ball then have the positional sense/awareness/speed to recover. We need **De Ligt/Maguire/KK**, I don't think Dias, Diop or Tuanzebe are good enough yet. Bailly and smalling should be kept. Jones and Rojo should both be binned for obvious reasons.

**Conclusion**

All of our rumored signings point to this being the main formation Ole will adopt this season. De Ligt, Rabiot, AWB, James and Fernandes all fit the type of signings we should be looking for and will represent a fantastic season. Of course, pre-season will be extremely important. The 4-4-2 diamond is a somewhat newish system, and preparation will be key. Ole and the coaching team have a huge task in front of them.

We can only hope Ed is ruthless and smart enough to get us the players we need, and not settle for much poorer choices.",reddevils

728,728,728,[Summer Series] 2019 /r/reddevils Census Results,"Thank you for taking part of this years edition of /r/reddevils' census! We had 1,839 responses over the course of several days.

[Here are the results.](https://imgur.com/a/cfPy4ld)

********************

**Age**

Unsurprisingly, 95.2% of our user base is under the age of 35. What might be somewhat interesting is that 59.5% of the userbase indicated that they were 25 and younger. Here is a [chart showing the break out by age group](https://i.imgur.com/osbAnbv.png) and also an [age distribution graph](https://i.imgur.com/XsG3NgB.png). We do have some older Reds, it is good to see we're not just a rabble of youngsters...just mostly one.

********************

**Gender**

Again, not surprisingly, /r/reddevils is overwhelmingly male. [97.8% of respondents indicated that they were male](https://i.imgur.com/lRwmvSo.png) which translates to [1,799 out of the 1,839 responses](https://i.imgur.com/smsyfZi.png). We do have some ladies here (28) along with some folks who preferred not to say (5) and some folks who marked themselves as Other (7). The others are as follows: three kinds of helicopter (1 Apache attack helicopter, one fighter helicopter, and one regular ol' helicopter), an alpha male (as opposed to a regular male?), a cyborg, a robot unicorn, and a Wookiee. [It appears that our resident Wookie has been here at least since the last census in 2012.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/12dguu/official_2012_rreddevils_census_results/) Good to see you're still around.

********************

**Employment**

[Most of the reds are employed \(71.5% across the Employed, Student Employed, and Self Employed categories\)](https://i.imgur.com/nVE5acT.png). We do have a lot of students here (37.4% across the two student categories) as well. There is one user I am absolutely jealous of though. [One individual](https://i.imgur.com/n7r7aec.png) indicated that they were retired. Enjoy retirement sir/madam. The rest of us have 30-40 years to go it appears.

********************

**Residence**

[The majority of /r/reddevils is UK or US based](https://i.imgur.com/8LYpyrl.png) (29.1% and 28.1%, respectively). Asia (which is overwhelmingly South and Southeast Asia) comes in third place followed closely by the Europe (non-UK). *So much for our American overlords* (don't deport me /u/sauce_murica).

[If we're breaking it down by the regions](https://i.imgur.com/LfqwDpt.png) I arbitrarily put into the census form, UK (England) is the clear winner with 360 members reporting living in England and another 89 specifically saying they are in Manchester. 

********************

**Season Ticketholder/Matches Attended**

Overwhelmingly, [most of us here are not season ticketholders](https://i.imgur.com/I7B1cqg.png) (98%). I did get some feedback that I didn't include an option for ""used to be, have cancelled because we're shit"" so I'll keep that in mind for next time.

[Most folks are unable to attend games](https://i.imgur.com/NS7t2HL.png) as well. We do have some very dedicated individuals who make it out to 31+ games per season. You guys are the real MVP.

******************

**How long have you been following football/Manchester United?**

[We have a lot of folks that are here for the long haul](https://i.imgur.com/olm4LM4.png). Very few have been following either football or Manchester United for 3 or less years. Our recent...bumps in the road...*obviously* did not have a part to play in that.

*****

**How long have you been a subscriber to /r/reddevils and how do you usually access Reddit?**

[We have a lot of new-ish users here](https://i.imgur.com/cKe0Tmk.png), which is expected since we've had two massive growth spurts in the last two years. We've also apparently had some folks who have been on the sub for 20+ years...despite the sub only being 8 years old. Silly of me to let that be an option...

This next bit is probably the most surprising to me. [Based upon the traffic data that Reddit provides](https://i.imgur.com/bkMnpK0.png), I expected a bit more of an even distribution for how folks access the sub. [Based on the census though, it appears that Reddit apps are the most popular by far](https://i.imgur.com/sCr7YF8.png). Now this is just a sample of our userbase so it very may be what the traffic stats are reporting but it appears our more active userbase prefers a Reddit app over anything else. When on desktop though, our active userbase prefers ""Old Reddit"" to ""New Reddit"" by over a factor of 2. Long live Old Reddit.

*****

**Favorite Current Player**

So this is the question most folks vocally said they had problems with...mainly because they couldn't choose since our squad was so shit. [Victor Lindelof is easily the favorite amongst voters though](https://i.imgur.com/zZ4vtmj.png), having amassed right around a quarter of the votes. The much slated Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford come comfortably in second and third, respectively. 

Shout out to the 111 other McTerminator lovers out there!

****

**Favorite All Time Player**

[During the previous census](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/12dguu/official_2012_rreddevils_census_results/), Eric Cantona won the vote with Scholes and Giggsy coming second and third. [In this years edition, Wayne Rooney was the undisputed king of /r/reddevils](https://i.imgur.com/qNUEHjW.png). He is followed by Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Scholes. Eric Cantona dropped to sixth place behind fifth placed Giggsy.

I was really happy to see Park get some love, he came in tenth (tied with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer). To my fellow Koreans/Park lovers out there, it's good to know I'm not alone!

730,730,730,Motivation in sport - a bit of psychology,"Hey all!  


There was [a post on motivation](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/bx2qqo/opinion_team_understanding_is_the_best_motivator/) 10 days ago, courtesy of u/ManUnited02 and I have commented that if you guys want, I can write up a small explanation on the psychology of motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

My background - I have been a competitive judoka for 10 years or so, and have just finished my Psychology Bsc. I have written a 10 page long paper (literature summary) on the motivation in sport, so I'm trying to make a short summary of that here.

&amp;#x200B;

So, motivation is fucking complicated. For starters, **there are at least 32 theories, on how it works** (Ford, 1992). It comes from the latin word ""movere"" which unsurprisingly means ""to move"". And frankly, it is goddamn hard to define. But, all in all, it is the complex of everything that effects behavior - what causes is, what makes it stick, what controls it (Gy√∂mb√©r and Kov√°cs, 2012).

There are a lot of notable motivation theories from a lot of different people, but I'm not going to go into details about them. Sorry,  Freud, Maslow, Bandura and Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi.

To be more specific, I won't really explain any theories in detail. I want this post to be short and easy to comprehend. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, motivation has a lot of factors, people are motivated by a lot of different things. **The main thing is, that there is not one thing that is a better motivator.** While Ryan and Deci argues that when you do stuff for the sake of doing it and do it for yourself (intrinsic motivation), not for the money, the trophies or other extrinsic factors - it is a higher level of motivation, there is no major evidence to suggest that it actually makes you do better. **In fact, even if you do it for the sake of doing it, other extrinsic factors (how much you earn, what the coach thinks, what your family thinks) still effect you.** 

Also, while you will see a lot of comments around the internet, that someone is a mercenary and only does such and such for money, no-one will admit that they only are in it for the money. There is **only one player, who have publicly stated that he did it for the money and nothing else** \- Benoit Assou-Ekotto (former Spurs player) - *""I play football to earn a living and make my life easier.‚Äù‚Ä¶""Yes, I play for the money but then doesn‚Äôt everybody who gets up in the morning and goes to work? They do it to provide for their family.""* (Goaldotcom, 2011).

He was in the PL, while a whole lot of other players, who do it for the sport and are motivated intrinsically, weren't, so as you can see, as long as you are motivated, it doesn't necessarily matter, how you are motivated (although this is only anecdotal evidence, but let's not dwell on it). But, in theory, as you become more and more internally motivated, you are a lot less dependent on other factors (Williams, 2010). So, if you love doing what you do, you will get less demotivated by earning less or winning less trophies.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, as you see, the important factor is that you - as a player - find something that motivates you. And that depends on your personality. Which is again determined by genetics, socialization and a multitude of other factors.**

&amp;#x200B;

**One other factor that is really important, is how much you believe in yourself, that you can achieve the goals you set.** Your self-belief, or self-efficacy determines what kind of goals you will set and if you actually believe that you can and will do them or not. If you don't believe in your skills or in yourself, you are more prone to giving up and not pursuing your goals.

&amp;#x200B;

**How can the coach help?**

While a lot depends on the players, a lot depends on the coach too. There are a lot of stuff the coach can do - but again - I'm trying to be short. The best coaches in general are positive,  communicative, give constructive feedback, make players feel better about themselves and set achievable goals. Threatening players, making them feel negative about themselves and giving negative feedback is generally not something you want in a coach.

There are exceptions though. Sometimes a good-old hair-dryer treatment is what turns the table and some players need really rigid coaches (approaches) to flourish. It all depends on the players' personality.

So - in summary, **the best coaches realize how to motivate each and every player and then do it accordingly. They are harsh and rigid with those, who need that kind of treatment, and are positive and flexible with others.**

One other factor that can benefit the coaches is if they know motivation-theories so they can use them.

&amp;#x200B;

**And a final TL;DR - Motivation depends on a hella lot of stuff, and the best thing a player do is to find out what motivates them and keeps them motivated - and then use it to be motivated. One way isn't necessarily better, than the other. Same with coaches.**",reddevils

Should I do it or is there any cheaper/better alternatives like getting the tickets through some websites?

1) When is the EXACT fixture date and time likely to be confirmed? Any time Saturday will be fine, as would be Sunday early afternoon. Any time past that will not be possible unfortunately due to flights, and it is not possible for me to get the next day off work.

2) When does the ballot open?

3) Is the ballot to buy tickets, or to have the opportunity to buy tickets? (See Q No. 1 for why this is important!)

4) In the event you miss out on the ballot, what are your alternative options for getting a seat?

5) Obviously I hope there will be more than me going. I know everyone who wants a seat needs an official membership but how does this work in terms of the ballot? Do you all enter your memberships together or are they all entered separately, meaning some of your group get through and others don't?

816,816,816,Less than a month until opening day. What have United done to fix last seasons problems?,"##Intro
Apologies for the wall of text. Skip to the conclusion for the TL;DR.

If you watched any of last season you'd likely agree it was (with the exception of the few weeks of Solskjaer's honeymoon period) a disaster. It's difficult to imagine quite where and how it could have been worse. By contrast it's fairly simple to identify some reasons *why* it was so bad. Quite a few of these apply to the entire post-SAF period, but I'll be focusing on last season and this.

I've listed a few basic problems, many of which tie into one another. I'll then go over what has been (and is being) done to rectify them*:

1. Toxic Manager.
2. Incompetent planning/player recruitment strategy.
3. Not enough quality at centre-back.
4. No right-sided width.
5. Aging first team right backs.
6. Aging defensive-midfielders.
7. General lack of work-rate and fitness.
8. Wage-structure and ongoing contract negotiations.
9. Problem players.

^* ^Feel ^free ^to ^add ^other ^problems ^as ^you ^see ^them, ^and ^comment ^about ^what ^is ^being ^done ^about ^them.

##1\. Toxic Manager
Mourinho was obviously a poisonous presence at the club toward the end of his tenure, and IMO he made his position untenable and had to go.

One particular memory I'll always have of his reign is of the West Ham away game in late September. Mourinho started with Scott McTominay in central defence. This was, in my view, a fairly blatant act of petulant, vindictive defiance, given that we had Bailly and Darmian on the bench that day. It was a big, childish middle-finger in Ed Woodward's direction. We quickly went behind in the game, and lost 3-1 having been out-competed (something we'd see time and again last season) to the extent that we made Mark Noble look like prime Edgar Davids.

It's clear, though, that Mourinho was never *really* the main problem.

**What has changed/will change?**

We obviously sacked him and brought in Solskjaer, who had a great honeymoon period. However, after a few weeks the hopeful promise of better times ahead was replaced by the realisation that nothing of significance had changed. Ole seemed to fairly quickly abandon his initial positive style of play for a more pragmatic ""Mourinho"" approach, as he began to graso the strengths, weaknesses, and fitness levels (more on that later) of the team he had inherited. We finished the season in pretty abysmal form.

##2\. Incompetent planning/player recruitment strategy
This of course ties into problem 1, because much of the reason for Mourinho's toxicity was born of a lack of respect and backing shown to him by the board, and in particular Ed Woodward who, it's plain to see, is not fit to run the sporting side of the club. Give Mourinho a contract extension, then a few months later refuse to sign his targets? Is it really a surprise he offered up the spiteful team selections and depressing press conferences that he did?

**What has changed/will change?**

Well...nothing so far, and there seems to be little hope anything will be changing on this front this summer. We did hear rumours that the club was looking to appoint an experienced sporting director, but those rumours soon became whispers that ex-players such as Rio Ferdinand and Darren Fletcher were being considered for the job, then faded away entirely. We continue with Woodward making the signings.

The signing of Daniel James (ANOTHER LW!) when we are crying out for a RW is fairly typical of our recent transfer strategy, although in a vacuum it looks like a good value signing. Hopefully it's suggestive of plans to move along some of our high-paid under-performing LWs in the near future.

##3\. Not enough quality at centre-back
Mourinho identified centre-back as a problem. To be fair, anyone watching us could identify centre-back as a problem. He previously brought in Bailly and Lindelof (though how much input he had in those signings is debatable). He discarded Bailly after he showed himself to be a very raw and risky player, and he showed almost as much distrust in Lindelof after his shaky start at United. Lindelof has settled in much better, and looks a decent signing but we need more and better in this area. Mourinho wanted Alderweireld, but the board clearly said no. Toby would have been an expensive, short-sighted, Matic-like signing, but would surely have made us better.

**What has changed/will change?**

Nothing so far this summer (get used to reading that), with not even a solid rumour of anything in this area. This has to be a priority this month, right?

##4\. No right-sided width
It's fine to favour one side of the pitch when you attack, but we have no reliable threat on the right, and haven't had for some number of seasons now. We mainly used Lingard and Mata there, and neither offer actual width on that side, as they look to drift inside with or without the ball. This makes us very predictable, and thus easier to defend against.

**What has changed/will change?**

Again, nothing really. Maybe the AWB signing (more later) allows us to use Dalot as a right winger? I'm not convinced we'll see any better results from the right side this season, and we've heard basically no rumours of any signings in this area.

##5\. Aging first team right-backs
Young started last year quite poorly at RB, but still seemed to fade, and put in some frankly embarrassing performances toward the end of the season. Valencia and Darmian were basically non-factors. Dalot was bought last year, but is a raw prospect rather than the finished article.

**What has changed/will change?**

Well, we allowed Valencia to leave. And then splashed out on AWB. This is a good signing with the potential to be a great one, though I'm not sure it solves our immediate lack of right sided attacking width, as he looks far more accomplished in defence than attack. But at least we signed someone for the first team, FINALLY.

##6\. Aging defensive-midfielders
Mourinho's signing of Matic was an ok, if typically short-sighted one**. Matic followed his good first season with his worst Premier League campaign (not helped by injury). He's functional, but shouldn't be more than a squad player at a club of United's stature, and seems to be on the decline. Herrera has had two good seasons in five years at United (2014/15 and 2016/17).

^** ^It's ^odd ^that ^Ed ^allowed ^this ^signing ^but ^not ^Alderweireld...

**What has changed/will change?**

Nothing helpful so far. We failed to offer Herrera the sort of contract he was holding out for, and he's off to Ligue 1. IMO he's not worth the money he's getting from PSG and, although this will be a blow to the dressing room, it shouldn't be a blow on the pitch provided we sign any decent defensively minded midfielder. Matic is on the books for next season with an option for a further year (which I suggest we don't take).

We needed younger reinforcements here before Herrera's departure. We certainly do now he's gone. Mario Lemina would be a solid if unspectacular replacement for Herrera, but we're going to need a replacement for Matic as well.

##7\. General lack of work-rate and fitness
We were the third laziest team in the Premier League last year behind only West Ham and Cardiff. The clubs we should be seriously competing with are all in the top 9 for distance covered. This is totally unacceptable. Mourinho complained about last year's pre-season preparations being disrupted by the world cup, but other teams had this same problem and dealt with it better, so as the head coach he surely has to take some blame for himself.

**What has changed/will change?**

That remains to be seen. United must simply must work harder next year and must prepare correctly over the next month. This is the one problem I have real hope and expectation will be sorted out.

##8\. Wage-structure and ongoing contract negotiations
We really, really shit the bed when we signed Sanchez. Not only has he been awful since joining, but his bloated contract has torn-up any semblance of a wage-structure and unsettled several players. Guys like De Gea are rightfully thinking that if Sanchez is worth 350k p/w, why aren't they?

**What has changed/will change?**

Well...Rashford just got 5-years 200k p/w. That's a lot for a 21 year-old who has much to prove. For reference, that's the same money De Gea's currently on. He is very valuable to the club as a home-grown player, and hopefully he builds on last year and makes that contract look like a bargain.

We're gonna have to decide what to do with De Gea. His uncertainty over his future must surely have played a role in him having probably his worst full Premier League season. I'd pay him, as he's a World-Class keeper who's likely not yet entered his prime.

Ultimately to settle things down we need to get rid of Sanchez, though that will likely necessitate paying him to play elsewhere.


##9\. Problem players
I'm mainly referring to Pogba and Lukaku here, but you could include others like Martial who's hearts don't appear to be in it.

If we learnt anything from the SAF years it has to be that no player is bigger than the club. You need to identify players who do not want to be here, and you need to have the resolve to get rid of them.

Beckham, Stam, van Nistelrooy, Keane, etc etc. Lots of great players were shown the door for undermining or disrespecting the club, or losing their focus.

**What has changed/will change?**

Nothing yet. Without an even vaguely acceptable bid yet we will be keeping players who are patently unhappy at the club. Solskjaer has taken a page from the SAF playbook and tried to deflect attention and blame back toward the media, but with the players themselves having literally been quoted angling for moves, this is a pretty transparent damage-control exercise.

If an acceptable bid comes in for Pogba and/or Lukaku, we should sell and reinvest.

##Conclusion/TL;DR

We have thus far done very little to solve any of our real problems, and I'm very disappointed that Woodward is still in charge of transfers, and that we've still done virtually nothing to address our squad weaknesses.

There is less than a month left till the start of the 2019/20 season. As it stands I have little cause for hope, and foresee another depressing season spent struggling for consistent form and vying for a top-4 finish.

The problems at the club are systemic, and change is needed almost from top to bottom. Realistically, until the board hires an actual experienced Technical Director/DoF, we will continue to see a total lack of direction in the transfer market, and we will continue to see managers fired when the real problems are above their heads.",reddevils

829,829,829,Can someone explain to me why we don‚Äôt have a director of football?,"It seems like we‚Äôve had so many good players come to the club over the past 6 years, they are average relative to their potential, leave, and then do well again at another club. We try to sign players and get rinsed as we don‚Äôt seem to have a long list of alternatives (particularly outside of the PL where there is less money).

What the fuck is going on? Why doesn‚Äôt the club bring someone in with prior experience as a D of F; who has an extensive network of contacts, and in depth knowledge of good players outside the PL. So we have more options.

Basically hammer down a play style and bring in players who suit and will develop. Bring in managers who will tweak rather than rework the style. We have boatloads of cash. We spend. But it goes nowhere. Because there is seemingly no vision at the club. Because we don‚Äôt seem to see alternatives to how we currently operate. 

I started supporting United in 2006 (am a foreign fan). I‚Äôve found at times over the past few years that I‚Äôm forcing myself to watch games as they aren‚Äôt enjoyable as a spectacle. I don‚Äôt even give a shit about trophies at this point. I just want to be excited to tune into a United game as I know I‚Äôm going to enjoy watching it. For one brief and glorious moment Ole brought that back. And then it fell apart as soon as he signed his contract. 

I know there are millions of other supporters internationally. But I honestly can‚Äôt image choosing to pick United over the alternatives anymore as someone just getting into the sport. It‚Äôs saddening to say the least. And it seems that while a director of football won‚Äôt instantly sort that, it can‚Äôt do anything other than be a positive for the club. So why are no steps seemingly being taken to fill the position? It seems like lip service rather than a sincere desire for change.

&gt; 100,000 fans expected for Man Utd's two games in Perth, against Perth Glory and Leeds United. 'The whole town is being painted red'. Not literally of course.

**6:12 AM BST:** Now to Ole!

**6:13 AM BST:** [Ole was just asked if he knew what a ""quokka"" was.](https://www.natureaustralia.org.au/explore/australian-animals/meet-the-quokka/)

https://twitter.com/sistoney67/status/1148823833731670016

&gt; OGS says 'no quick fix' re squad. Says no bid received for any @ManUtd player.

https://twitter.com/sistoney67/status/1148823998312013825

&gt; OGS: ""We are Man Utd, we don‚Äôt have to sell players. I don‚Äôt want to call it an agenda against Paul. He has a heart of gold. He has never been a problem.""

OGS: ‚ÄúWe know last year was disappointing. Also know what to aim for this year. Have to close the gap. Have trophies to fight for. That‚Äôs what MU is about - bouncing back after a difficult season.‚Äù

OGS: ""We're Man United, we don't have to sell. We don't have to overpay either. It's about buying the right players for the right price.""

https://twitter.com/sistoney67/status/1148824559828647937?s=19

&gt;OGS: ""We are still in the market and looking to do some business. We are patient. We don‚Äôt have to sell and we don‚Äôt have to overpay.""

&gt; OGS on @ManUtd fans: ""They want us to be successful. The loudest ones are not the greatest or the best fans. When I am out there and speaking to them they are all very positive. They want to see us win again.""

https://twitter.com/sistoney67/status/1148825665875013632

**6:26 AM BST:** Ole telling Simon Stone that he was quiet today.

https://twitter.com/sistoney67/status/1148826087578673157

&gt; OGS says Sanchez will have three weeks off but will be fit when he returns. On De Gea contract: ""We hope DDG contract will get sorted. I am positive. We are lucky and happy to have him.""

[Please refer to this thread regarding our new rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/cb0p88/meta_in_the_know_announcement_thread/).

We are banning any ""ITK"" posts. It has been difficult to truly verify the validity of these types of users and led to abusive behavior and even doxxing in some cases.

We are more than happy to have people discussing transfer news and rumors, but there will be no more referencing unknown sources at the club. Moving forward, anyone who believes they have inside info a la bloodgate is welcome to send in a modmail. However such posts/comments made without prior mod approval will be removed

It has been mentioned, but the toxicity and abuse towards the sub, within the sub, and towards other subs has been too high. We as moderators have our share of blame in this, but we want to stress that this kind of behavior is not acceptable and we are taking these measures primarily to avoid these things. We want /r/reddevils to be a place where anyone and everyone is welcome to discuss and enjoy the best club on earth without fear of abuse or ridicule.

Which leads us to 2 other small reminders. The report button is your friend, we are way more likely to find and remove and/or ban rule breaking comments if you report them. The downvote button is not a ""I disagree or don't like your statement button"", better discussion is generally had by using the upvote button more liberally and avoiding the downvote one whenever possible.

‚Ä¢ He joined us from Juventus for ¬£18m in Summer 2017 (so expect a signing of at LEAST ¬£18)

Now that everyone's had a bit to calm down and the mod team had time to discuss, we want to address what happened yesterday and talk about the state of the sub moving forward.

**Firstly**: we can again confirm that [/u/spoofex](https://www.reddit.com/u/spoofex/) has deleted his account and stepped down from the moderation team as a result of abuse he received. Whether you agreed or disagreed with his posting methods, I hope we can all agree that abuse is over the line. We do want to be clear though, this is not about Spoofex in particular. Multiple users have face unwarranted abuse and we believe that a line needs to be drawn on the situation.

As a side note, we are not currently looking for more moderators to replace his spot. We will address mod numbers at a later time

**Secondly**: We are discontinuing the Muppet Thread. Having multiple transfer threads has led to unfortunate divisions within the sub. We will therefore be condensing all transfer talk into one thread, the transfer thread, pursuant to the transfer thread rules currently in place. If you would like to discuss other United related events or have less serious discussion, please use the Daily Discussion thread.

**Thirdly**: We are banning any ""ITK"" posts. It has been difficult to truly verify the validity of these types of users and led to abusive behavior and even doxxing in some cases.

We are more than happy to have people discussing transfer news and rumors, but there will be no more referencing unknown sources at the club. Moving forward, anyone who believes they have inside info a la bloodgate is welcome to send in a modmail. However such posts/comments made without prior mod approval will be removed

**Fourthly**: It has been mentioned, but the toxicity and abuse towards the sub, within the sub, and towards other subs has been too high. We as moderators have our share of blame in this, but we want to stress that this kind of behavior is not acceptable and we are taking these measures primarily to avoid these things. We want [/r/reddevils](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/) to be a place where anyone and everyone is welcome to discuss and enjoy the best club on earth without fear of abuse or ridicule.

The downvote button is not a ""I disagree or don't like your statement button"", better discussion is generally had by using the upvote button more liberally and avoiding the downvote one whenever possible.

To add to the above, it is not unlikely that we as a sub will face ridicule from other subs. There's no need to retaliate in kind. If people come to the sub looking to cause problems please report them and move on. If you don't want to face those kinds of comments, we would encourage you to either ignore the comments themselves or stay off of those subs short term.

As a small aside, anyone coming here from Twitter: Please read over the rules and be aware of both those and general posting etiquette.

**Fifthly**: In speaking with the the users running the muppetiers account, we understand that as a result of these planned changes they have made the decision to open the muppetiers sub for muppet-related discussion. For anyone that enjoys muppetry and/or ITK stuff, you are all welcome to participate there (and here, as well), but we have made the decision to focus this sub on more substantial discussion and will be avoiding those subjects as mentioned.

Now, this post will also stand as a discussion point on the above subject or a place for users to ask questions. Please understand that there are some things we cannot or will not discuss but we will be as transparent as possible.",reddevils

872,872,872,Actual Unpopular Opinion: I don't think things are quite that bad,"Let's not forget the way the team started when Ole first took charge. Those players, minus Herrera, are still there. When we were clicking in the first part of the year, we were easily a top 4 side. If we sign Bruno Fernandes, who is better going forward than Herrera, and play Daniel James or Chong on the right, along with AWB at RB, I think we will be alright. Arsenal are shambolic and Chelsea are in a horrible state of affairs as well. After a summer and pre season of building up fitness and Ole trying to play the right football, I think we will comfortably make top 4. I feel my position would be strengthened if we signed Harry Maguire, but nonetheless, those are my honest opinions. I definitely see how it could go pear shaped halfway through the season, but I do not think this is blind optimism. There is a long way to go to be the best in England/Europe, but I think we can be reasonably hopeful for a top 4 finish and a deep run in the Europa League. Thoughts?

EDIT: I realize the owners are bloodsuckers and Ed Woodward is a power hungry control freak who won't hire a DOF. I know the structure of the club is pathetic. I'm purely talking about the football side of things.",reddevils

Rest of Article for those interested.

*Ander Herrera‚Äôs transfer to PSG was made official last week, with the midfielder joining the French champions as a free agent from Manchester United.*

*His arrival has not been met with a great fanfare from the club‚Äôs local media and there‚Äôs doubt over what his role in the club‚Äôs project will be. The Spaniard will have to impress quickly to convince people he‚Äôs been signed as more than simply an asset to sell on in a future transfer window.*

*Marca today do make a big deal of the transfer, or at least a big deal of their chat with the footballer.*

*One of the questions put to Herrera is why he chose to leave Manchester United despite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanting to keep him at the club. *

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like looking at the past,‚Äù Herrera said. ‚ÄúBut there were differences regarding the project and my importance within it. I was very happy, I have a lot to thank the club for, the fans and also Solskjaer. He did a lot for me to stay, but things didn‚Äôt happen. They arrived late and, by then, I‚Äôd already made the decision to play in Paris.*

*‚ÄúI am very happy to have made that decision because I am enjoying this magnificent city, this beautiful stadium and this club, which has a glamour few can match.‚Äù*

*Judging his time at Old Trafford, he explained: ‚ÄúIt has been fantastic. In five years I have played 189 games and I have been important for all the coaches. It is true that that the MVP (Sir Matt Busby award, 2016/17) makes one feel special and very happy, but I keep every moment that I have lived.‚Äù*

*Marca put it to Herrera that he had ‚Äònumerous offers‚Äô when leaving Manchester United, and asked why he chose PSG: ‚ÄúBecause to leave United, the biggest team in England, you need something like PSG, which is the biggest in France. I could not play in another English club. The PSG is a group in continuous development and which is in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.*

*‚ÄúI visited it as a tourist and I fell in love. Now I have the chance to play for his team, which has a very high ceiling and goals, and which has some of the best players in the world.‚Äù*

*Inevitably, Herrera was also asked about former teammate David de Gea potentially moving to PSG, and he answered: ‚ÄúDavid is my friend and is one of the best in the world, for me top 3, but here there are already two great goalkeepers. There is Areola, and Trapp returns after completing a great stage at Eintracht. You have to respect the people who are already there and expect Trapp and Areola to have a great season.‚Äù**",reddevils

925,925,925,What is Ole's philosphy ?,"Serious thread.

&amp;#x200B;

""The United Way"" is not a philosophy and Fergies imprint cannot be mimicked in any way. Ole arrived and we pressed higher and played more forward passes.

Games went on and our xG and xA began to show that luck was more on our side than an actual style of play. Towards the end of the season, our record was awful and we had reverted back to ""parking the bus"". The only problem is our defensive fragility was completely exposed.

Now this summer, we expected 4-5 players in and 4-5 out. Reality is we probably will sell 1-3 (two of them being Rom and Pogba). We potentially might not sign anyone else and if we do they will most likely be ""young and hungry"".

Our philosophy is all over the place from the players we are interested in (Maguire, Longstaff and Bruno) to the players we have retained. They do not adhere to any style of play and have been proven, shit players. We seemingly are trying to recreate ""a great British core"" which is an awful way to rebuild a dying football club. We need a system and a manager who is tactically aware.

Ole could be that guy but has rarely shown any initiative and instead of attempting to make an impact on the team his stance is always reverting back to the ""its the united way"". He promised that he would be successful and that some players would never play for this club again which has proven to be a lie. Our style hasn't dramatically changed after 5 months with a new coach. Flashback to our previous managers and their imprint was very defined 5-6 months into their tenure.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: At Modle, he did imprint a style of play but there are two very key talking points about his career.

1. The Norwegian league at that time and still is essentially equivalent to our league 1/2. Ole, his players and staff all acknowledged the lack of technical football within the league. Ole was credited for brining technical, fast football to the league. He essentially took basic modern-day football and applied the same philosophies within an old-mentality league. Modle was faster and sharper than other teams as they didn't ""route-one"". Modle have not won any trophies under Ole since 2012/13. 
2. When he joined Cardiff, Ole promised the fans that they would play ""fast, exciting football"" and that they would dramatically reshape the foundation of the club. He instead got them into the relegation zone and signed too many players that did not adhere to any type of style. His singings from Molde were particularly worrisome as they couldn't get into the team nor adapt. When he was fired from Cardiff they were in a far worse position than when Ole came into the club. 

This is not an #OleOut thread but I feel like these points should be discussed more. Molde were the first Norwegian team to play ""modern-day football"" but they were soon caught up by their rivals. Ole still hasn't made any real impact with these players and our constant changing on formations begins to show our lack of a plan. AWB (great) and James (good hopefully) are good signings as a start BUT Ole essentially acknowledged that we needed far more in this summer. Ed is not solely in charge of transfers. The actual transfer system is complicated as there are so many different departments involved. Matt Judge is our chief negotiator and he evidently sucks. The scouting network is involved and the management needs to also have their say on targets. It is true that the once-great Manchester United are now rapidly declining in terms of their pull.",reddevils
926,926,926,Saul Niguez ownership and release clause: Complex nature revealed by Football leaks,"According to [documents recovered by football leaks](https://oload.biz/f/jISDScLe59w/AtleÃÅtico_de_Madrid_%26_Quality_Football_Ireland_Limited_-_Saul_NÃÉiguez.pdf) the following is true:

- Quality Sports investments bought 40% of player's economic rights when he was 16 by making a payment of 1m.

- Saul has a 136m release clause at Atletico right now (from other reports) but only 60% of it would be paid to Atletico while rest 40% would go to QSI (headed by Jorge Mendes and former United executive Peter Kenyon)

- If QSI agrees to transfer and Saul doesn't, Atletico will be forced to pay 40% of 135m, so 54m to QSI and the full ownership of the player would be transferred to Atletico Madrid.

982,982,982,How did you become a Man United Fan? || Origin Story ||,"How and when did you guys fall in love with Manchester United? I am just curious about how people end up associating themselves with a club especially when they are not from Manchester or even England. Was it a player? Was it a particular game? Or was it a kit? 

P.S. The last one is apparently not uncommon. I have a friend who is a massive Everton fan who started off as a toffee after he fell in love with their 2010/11 kit!

My Story:

Being a mid 90s kid, I grew up during the time when Manchester United was consistently at the top of English football. My father was a United fan since the 90s (about the time football broadcasting started in my country). He worked long hours and hence I barely got time to hang out with him during the week. But on weekends, I wanted to spend a lot of time with my dad. So every Saturday/ Sunday evening he would sit down in front of the telly with some snacks and shout at the TV screen every so often when he thought Ronaldo was doing unnecessary stepovers. I was like 7-8 at the time and had no clue what was happening. I just joined him and that's how I got into football. 

I remember not understanding anything but getting excited when Ronaldo and Rooney took on players for fun. I thought of Sir Alex as this old guy who chewed gum all the time and would get hyperactive and angry in short bursts.

Time flew by and without even realizing it I fell in love with the game and the club. But in my early teens, when internet and social media were a new thing, I was super active on a Man United fan Facebook group. I could barely relate to other fans. Yes, I had watched a lot of Man United but had no knowledge about the history and the heritage of the club. I had no access to such stuff apart from Man United specials on ESPN and Star Sports (Local channel that broadcasted the EPL). So, it was from around 2007 that I learned about the club, the rivalries, the legends, etc. I stopped saying Man U, understood the dislike for You Know Who and truly appreciated the work of Sir Alex Ferguson over the previous decade. 

I recently visited Manchester and Old Trafford for the first time and it was surreal. I never knew I could be so emotionally attached to a place I had never visited. It was overwhelming. 

As I sit here looking forward to the day I watch my first game at Old Trafford, my head just ran through the years of memories and it got me thinking of other fans and their origin story (if I can call it that).

Looking forward to hearing your story!",reddevils

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

Have fun doing what you're doing, and discuss the anonymous ITKs legitimacy all you want, but targeting individuals, and/or haranguing / harassing members of our subreddit is a no-no.

1003,1003,1003,De Gea's Legacy,"Hi all,

In light of the news and general expectation that De Gea will most likely be penning a new deal at United, it got me thinking of where he's at now in terms of the legacy he'll leave when he does call it a day at United, whether for a transfer or potentially retirement.

Didn't have enough time to deep-dive thoroughly enough to get all goalkeepers' appearance stats, but anyways, here goes: at 362 appearances, De Gea is closing in on Schmeichel's 398 appearances and Alex Stepney is up there at the top with 539 (7th all-time most appearances for United).

If De Gea averages the 50-odd appearances per season he has in recent years for the reported 4 years we're extending, that could make him our highest-appearing goalkeeper of all time, which would be an amazing achievement for someone who started his tenure off with so much doubt surrounding him (and, in my opinion at least, undeservedly has some surrounding him again).

So, I guess now that I've put these numbers out, my question would be: if De Gea were to achieve that feat, and possibly only get a few more trophies along the way, where would he rank for you among our all-time goalkeepers? I know he might never reach the trophy-laden heights of Schmeichel (15 trophies with United vs DDG's current 7), but just figured I'd see what everyone thinks!",reddevils

1017,1017,1017,Scouting the Current CB Targets,"Someone can probably do this far far better than me (and please expand upon what I have in the comments if you can), but with all the recent buzz about bids for CBs, may be beneficial to break them down.

I am ranking these by the likelihood of them happening:

**Harry Maguire (Leicester City):**

Age: 26

Size: 6'4 (193 cm), 220¬†lbs (99.8 kg)

Dominant Foot: Right / Plays as LCB for Leicester and NT

WhoScored Season Rating: **7.01**

Stats: 3 Goals / 1 Assist

Discipline: 6 Yellows / 1 Red

**Strengths**: A vocal leader in the defence, size and strength, set piece weapon and great in the air, pushing forward and composure on the ball, excellent passer and can initiate a counter. He won, on average 3.8 aerial duels a match, 4.9 clearances a match, 6.2 long balls a game, and an 85% passing percentage. He is also still years off what should be considered his prime as a defender. With proper coaching he could very well reach world class status. Helps with the Home Grown quota. Currently first choice center back with the National Team, which adds some prestige. Premier League proven. *Maguire looked far better with the appointment of Brendan Rodgers, as he was better suited to a deeper line and the counter attacking system Rodgers employed (credit to u/*[*Dunkaegon*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dunkaegon/)*)*

**Weaknesses**: Athleticism, slower than the current gold-standard for World Class backs (VVD, Ramos, and Koulibaly), needs a strong DM to cover him in situations where he can get beat on the counter due to lack of awareness and poor positioning, and can be a reckless defender in 1:1 situations. As we do not have a strong DM and are not sure how the Shaw and AWB pairing will offer in cover, Maguire's positioning may pose a significant problem if he tries to play further up the pitch, placing himself out of position for the counter, though this will all depend on what kind of line we are going to implement next season.

From LCFC fans:

""Strengths are on the ball he is one of the best in the league, both driving out of defence and passing. He's also good in the air, physically and will definitely be a good leader of any defence. However he is quite slow compared to some top class defenders like VVD and Ramos. He also does not have the best awareness or positioning which leads to the odd mistake. Ndidi does a great job of covering him and considering you lot haven't got that type of ball winner right now it would definitely be a big problem ""

""IMO he's worth the prices that are being quoted. Don't let Leicester's indifference to him being sold make you think we're pulling a fast one on you. Leicester is currently blessed with an abundance of quality in the CB position so if Maguire were to be sold that would open the door for one of our many prospects to take his starting spot. And if he's not then we're still left with an amazing player ourselves who seems to want to stay. It's one of those situations where it's a win-win for the club no matter what. To add to that he's not trying to force his way out like Mahrez did, which demonstrates Maguire's loyalty and ability to be a team leader and not disrupt the dressing room atmosphere. He's basically the opposite of a diva, which I think is the kind of player ManU would appreciate at this moment.""

Quoted price: &gt; ¬£ 70m

**Issa Diop**

Age: 22

Size: 6'4 (194 cm), 202 lbs (92 kg)

Dominant Foot: Right / Plays as RCB for West Ham

WhoScored Season Rating: **6.89**

Stats: 1 goal

Discipline: 4 Yellows/ 0 Reds

**Strengths**: Tall, broad and imposing, Diop is a bully in the back. He plays with a great deal of physicality, and looks like he has the potential to evolve into a world class player like VVD or Koulibaly, as he grows into a more technical, ball-playing CB. He has great covering speed and has shown on numerous occasions his ability to get back into position to cover the right-back or to stop players breaking past him at pace. Premier League proven. Will only grow in terms of technical ability. His discipline has improved immensely. He did not receive a single red in the PL this year, and actually has not been sent off in his previous three seasons in the top flight. Impressive composure in terms of defending and positioning. Also, playing within what might be a true golden generation of French central defenders, Diop may well be inspired and driven to perform at the highest level to attempt to secure his spot during future call ups. *Diop also has been more exposed to attackers running at him a lot more at a club like West Ham than he would if he were playing at a top 6 club. (credit to u/*[*Dunkaegon*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dunkaegon/)*)*

**Weaknesses**: Diop brings the least to the table, out of all of the targets, in terms of technical ability and the ability to play out the back. He is not as composed with the ball at his feet, and can misplace quite a few passes per match. This might not allow him to slot into the side comfortably, but these are abilities that can be improved upon and will grow naturally with time and patience. If Koulibaly is truly out of reach (and I think he is), then Diop can be the young signing that can grow into a player of that value.

Quoted price: &gt; ¬£ 50m

**Ruben Dias**

Age: 22

Size: 6'1 (186 cm), 170¬†lbs (77 kg)

Dominant Foot: Right / Plays as RCB for Benfica and LCB for NT

WhoScored Season Rating: **6.96**

Stats: 3 Goals / 1 Assist

Discipline: 10 Yellows/ 0 Reds

**Strengths:** Quite young and mature beyond his age, Dias has already established himself in the NT set up and has proven to be a stabilizing force for SLB. Despite his leaner stature, he averaged a hefty 3.2 aerial duels won, per match, 3.4 clearances, and average 1.4 tackles a game. His positioning is superb. Like are other targets, he is comfortable playing out the back. 86% passing rate and 4.4 long balls a game, would make him a perfect fit as we look to field a more attacking side, brisk on the counter in the upcoming season. At 22, he still has the ability to grow and bulk up, which could make him an even more imposing defender. He also impressed against us in the Champions League. That has to count for something.

**Weaknesses**: Aggressiveness. He earned 10 yellow cards in league play this past season. The Premier League is a tougher, more challenging league, and he will have to temper down or could very well follow the path of the CBs we are trying to replace (Bailly, Rojo, Jones). He is still a tad unproven. The Portuguese League isn't quite the same quality as the PL or Serie A. His performances for the National Team instill confidence, but there could still be a significant learning curve for him to overcome. If we want an immediate fix on our back-line, Dias may not be the immediate fix. But he surely has the potential to link up with a fellow Benfica alumni and lead our back-line for years to come.

**Quoted price**: Release clause reported to be between **‚Ç¨50-60m**, but with Benfica attempting to increase it to ‚Ç¨80m to maximize value. Every indication that they will not settle for any less than the release clause, especially after Madrid met Felix's valuation early this summer.

**Kalidou Koulibaly (Napoli)**

Age: 28

Size: 6'2 (186 cm), 220¬†lbs (90 kg)

Dominant Foot: Right / Plays both LCB and RCB, but primarily LCB for Napoli and NT

WhoScored Season Rating: **7.06**

Stats: 2 Goals / 2 Assist

Discipline: 10 Yellows / 1 Red

**Strengths:** Koulibaly is a physical freak.He is also rapid. He can cover ground with the best of them when caught out of position. This is where he is a considerable upgrade over Maguire, and puts him on the level of VVD or Ramos. He is comfortable on the ball, and can initiate attacks going forward. In terms of passing, he averaged 4.5 long balls a game, and an impressive 89% passing rate. He is still only 28 years old, and is entering his prime as a defender. He has also been a stalwart for Napoli. I do not think he has missed a single match for them (please correct if this is wrong). That is something that will make United fans salivate, but I am going to address this in the weaknesses as well.

**Weaknesses**: At 6‚Äô2 he is slightly less of an aerial threat than Maguire, having averaged 2.2 aerial duels won a game and averaged 3.9 clearances a game, but at his height, he is still an impact player in that regard. Koulibaly's positioning is not perfect, and instead of using his pace to get in front of players, he can lean on the rash tackle from time to time, and this leads to a commitment of fouls. A friend of mine who religiously watches Serie A, said he was quite lucky to walk away from some challenges with only a yellow to show for.  Like I said above, he is an absolute stalwart and has rarely missed any time for Napoli. This is great to hear. But also, the pessimist in me tends to think that an injury crisis could be on the horizon. That kind of stability does not last for ever, and especially not for someone who relies heavily on their athleticism.

*Note: Koulibaly suffered a drop in form after he started getting targeted by racist behavior and chants towards the second half of this past season. This is something that is far less likely to happen in England. (credit to u/*[*Dunkaegon*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dunkaegon/)*)*

Quoted price: &gt; ¬£ 120m (release clause of ‚Ç¨150m) Honestly, this is not going to happen. Napoli are pushing for the title this year. They are making massive investments in the squad and just brought in a top CB to pair with him. He is their most integral player. Yes the 50m or so difference between Maguire and him seems like not that much when Koulibaly is arguably a top 3 CB in the world. But Napoli don't want to sell. Unless we want to obliterate the transfer record for a CB and our own transfer record, I do not see him joining this week. But won't completely rule it out.

We have been connected with these players within the past season, but there has been no rumblings from reputable journos to date in regards to these players.

1034,1034,1034,International Duty and the Upcoming Season,"One thing I haven't seen commented on much is how few United players are participating in the various international tournaments this summer. Currently, the African Cup of Nations, the Copa America and the Gold Cup are ongoing, as well as the Euro U21 Championships, and these are the players from the top 6 Premier League sides.


- Man City (7): Mahrez (Algeria), Gabriel Jesus, Fernandinho, Ederson (all Brazil), Aguero, Otamendi (both Argentina), Foden (England U21)

- Liverpool (5): Salah (Egypt), Mane (Senegal), Firmino, Alisson (both Brazil), Keita (Guinea)

- Spurs (4): Aurier (Ivory Coast), Wanyama (Kenya), Foyth (Argentina), Sanchez (Colombia)

- Chelsea (4): Willian (Brazil), Pulisic (USA), Abraham, Mount (both England U21)

- Arsenal (4): El Neny (Egypt), Iwobi (Nigeria), Torreira (Uruguay), Guendouzi (France U21)

- Man Utd (2): Alexis Sanchez (Chile), Wan-Bissaka (England U21)

I only included U21 players who stand a chance of being a part of the first team next season. 

The fact that there are so few United players in these tournaments is mainly a reflection of the majority of the squad being from Europe. Romero and Bailly probably would have been involved had they not been injured. And Fred just wasn't called up. 

But there is a positive to this as well. After last year's World Cup, there was a lot of talk about how the players were tired starting the season. So hopefully this means that United's players will be more rested and carrying fewer injuries than their rivals. 

Especially for teams with countries who go the distance in the AFCON which doesn't end until July 19th. That is only 3 weeks before the opening fixtures for the Premier League. For example, it's not impossible that Salah and Mane won't return to training until after the season has started. 

Meanwhile, the only United player to get significant game time is Alexis Sanchez and he is probably the one player we needed to play a lot and play well as it will hopefully boost his confidence, or at the very least, put him in the shop window given how well he has done in the Copa America. 

Obviously this is all digging for small crumbs of comfort and trying to find any ways to close the gap from last season. But you never know, one or more of the teams above United may struggle as a result of this.",reddevils

1059,1059,1059,State of the Sub - July 2019,"Hi all,

We haven't done this in two years so there are quite a few things to go through here. So strap in! We intend to do these annually from now on.

***
Let's just start with a few announcements. Things that have been implemented since the last update, to provide a brief recap of what has happened in the subreddit.

***

**""Monday Meme-aways""**

Over the years we've had quite a firm stance on the no meme's rules on the subreddit. However, we relaxed on our position mid last year to accommodate subscribers who want memes by setting up the designated ""Meme Monday"" threads for memes. Our main rule still applies and standalone meme posts will be removed but feel free to use the designated ""Meme threads"" and the comments section as you please.

***

**A Muppets World**

We've also introduced the ""Transfer Muppets Threads"" for all the transfer water-cooler gossip and in-the-know (ITK) tittle-tattle. Do take note that information shared in these threads are not to be taken as gospel. We had to have a separate avenue for information coming from unverifiable, unattributable sources and as such anything shared in them threads are to be taken with a fistful of salt. 

It is also to be noted that these threads have led to a useful community led initiative that is the ""Muppetiers Programme"". /u/jroades267 and /u/ubergorp have taken it upon them to collate and post information anonymously from people claiming to have ITK information. They've been doing so independently, without any affiliation with the moderators of /r/reddevils. Despite the growing pains and challenges they face, we'd like to commend community led efforts that aim to contribute to the subreddit..

***

**/r/reddevils Community Awards**

/r/reddevils is also officially apart of reddit's community awards! Community Awards are awards unique to our community, and subscribers can give them to each other as a substitute for reddit's silver/gold/platinum awards. [These are the awards currently available but we're certainly looking to add more over time.](https://i.imgur.com/twSk0kq.png) A small portion of coins from Community Award purchases will be deposited into the /r/reddevils‚Äôs coin balance and these coins will be used to reward members for their contribution when it comes to our official /r/reddevils Awards!

***

**A Sticky Summer**

For those of you who still like to read the sub, but not so fussed about the Transfer related talk, /u/zSolaris has laid out plans for our Summer of daily discussion threads, where we've got themed daily discussion thread for people to chime-in on. These discussion threads have been scheduled for the entire transfer window and we'd like to get your opinions on anything you'd like to see included in these threads.

***

**Rules, Regulations No More Tribulations**

The Rules for this subreddit have been updated and we've included a few new rules to make /r/reddevils a better place for everyone. We've added the following rules that might be worth having a look at:

* **Rule #10: Press Conference Quotes.** Press conference quoted are to kept to one thread to stop the rat race to spam the sub with multiple quotes from multiple twitter accounts. However, on occasion, we allow one or two posts from out top tiered journalists if it's been a slow day and it better helps to facilitate discussion.

* **Rule #12: No editorializing of post titles.** If you're going to make a submission (news stories, tweets, instagram posts, etc.), please do not editorialize title. Leave the original title or use the content of the social media post, whenever possible, as the discussion about the submission will be largely based of your editorialized title rather than the actual content of the submission. Minor edits to make a title clearer are encouraged (i.e., changing ""best player"" to ""[Juan Mata] best player"" to avoid ""click-baitey"" titles.

* **Rule #13: Banned Sources/Content or Illegal Streams.** We keep a running list of banned sources in the [Transfer Tier Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/wiki/transfer-reliability-guide) as Tier 5, these are sources that are known to be poor in content and will not be allowed in the subreddit. We also ban content that may attract unwanted attention from reddit administrators, specifically illegal streams. While we understand trying to watch our team can be hard, all non-legal streams and requests will be removed. Reddit admins have been on a mission to eradicate any community carrying illegal content and we don't want to give them any reason to take a look at us.

***On a side note, please do take note that posts that need to be removed are easily spotted by our moderators but comments that need action might slip through our fingers in bigger threads. We're going to need your help to highlight these comments using the report button.***

***

**Subreddit Census**

A /r/reddevils census was finally conducted after a 7 year gap and it might be an interesting read for anyone wanting to see the dynamics of our user group. We intend to do this annually moving forward. [Link to /r/reddevils census](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/c0wv4h/summer_series_2019_rreddevils_census_results/) 

***

**Mod Matters**

Our moderation team has also expanded over the last year. We've welcomed two new additions in /u/sauce_murica and /u/crebtheberc to ensure that our subreddit is being moderated at all times throughout the day. For those who were unaware, /u/spoofex took a brief sabbatical after years of moderating this place and rejoined the mod team recently. We did a recent AMA as part of our summer series, do let us know if you'd like for it to be an annual thing. It provided a place where you could ask questions related to how our subreddit was run and we felt that it helped clear some doubts on how we moderate this place. [\[Link to AMA\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/bvjow7/summer_series_we_are_the_mods_of_rreddevils_ama/)

***

**Subscriber Count Update**

Our subreddit has also expanded quite a bit over the last few years. To put things into context, we had 60,629 subscribers the time we did a ""State of the Sub"" post in 2017 and the number has increased to 167,415 subscribers in just two years. As things stand, we're currently the second biggest footy club sub on reddit just behind /r/liverpoolfc who have a 2000 subscriber lead on us. 

***

Feel free to discuss on any of the updates mentioned above and give us your opinion on the changes. We will listen to the general vibe of the sub and make any necessary changes if need be.

***

**Transparency Report** 

We've banned 631 users and unbanned 155 users in the past 12 months (a significant increase that is expected of with the sudden increase in subscriber count), of which about 138 are bots. The most common reasons for bans are:

* Self-Promotion without Contribution (this includes the bots)
* Brigading/trolling other teams subreddits (both outsiders coming here and users here attacking other subreddits)


We have received 0 requests through modmail to provide sponsorship or endorsements to a product or company in exchange for goods in the last year. We've had a long-running stance that the mod team will not accept products, payment, or goods in exchange for promoted posts/biasing the community.

1069,1069,1069,A bot for Going for Gold competition,"#A bot for Going For Gold

Hello fellow reddevils. 

/u/Pedantic_Pat has been running this competition wonderfully and I thought I could help him out by making things easier for him. I saw a post two weeks ago from /u/Pedantic_Pat about wanting someone to make a new bot to calculate points for next season of Going for Gold. So, I made one and added more features to it to make it self-managed.


###Here are some of the stuff the bot can do:

* Submit a new post for a match's prediction
* When the match begins, it collects the users' predictions and store it
* Calculates points based on the match's result automatically
* Posts the points table in the next match's post (I am still working on this)
* Supports EPL, UEFA competitions for now. (I am using a football website's API to get match details. They don't provide details for FA and League Cup sadly)  
* Keeps track of points for individual match types(EPL, Europa,etc) as well as the overall score.  


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

###Game information: &amp;nbsp;

* The scoring mechanism remains the same as /u/Pedantic_Pat's. 
* The structure for a prediction remains the same as  /u/Pedantic_Pat's as well. The only difference is that the user will be making a new comment and will not be replying under /u/Pedantic_Pat's scoreline comment.



How do the league points work?

Correct Result (Win, Draw, Loss): +2 points

Correct Scoreline: +3 points

Each correct goal+scorer: +1 point

Best prediction of game (winner of gold): +5 points

If you lost out on gold due to tiebreaker, you get +3 points


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

####More information about this:  

I will be posting the threads using this account. I am also planning to make the bot's code open source soon, so that anyone else willing to contribute can do so. There are still some things I wish to do with this bot - like, replying back a user's points when someone asks for it (something like the goal-bot), and add more match types in the future(FA cup, League cup).

I reached out to /u/Pedantic_Pat about this but didn't talk to other mods yet. So, I thought of making this thread to discuss about this. I hope I made something useful!",reddevils

1126,1126,1126,Discussion about Alex Tuanzebe,"If we don't sign any CB this window I think Tuanzebe deserve spot with Lindelof in our backline. 

Pro :
1. Ball playing ability and good passing range
2. Rarely doing stupid mistake unlike bailly, jones, rojo, smalling
3. Not injury prone like bailly, jones, rojo (he play 2400 minutes for villa last season)
4. He is quick for CB, if we play high line he is reliable to recover from counter.


Cons
1. Defense ability still unproven in EPL, even though I think he is good enough especially on the ground 
2. Might be bullied against strong targetman 


Tl:dr he is similar to lindelof and partner them means we will be very comfortable with the ball and play from the back, but if we play against hoofball team who use giroud/deeney as their targetman even tho if we go against them we can sub smalling for axel.

Of course I still hope we sign a quality CB but if other club wants to rinse us I think Tuanzebe is our best bet.

I limited it to goal contributions because that's what was in the article. 

Gerrard: 212 in 504  - 0.42
Lampard: 279 in 609 - 0.46
Scholes: 162 in 499 - 0.32
Pogba: 47 in 95 - 0.49 
De bruyne: 69 in 120 - 0.58
David Silva: 176 in 382 - 0.46

Read what you may of these stats. 

A few things I'm thinking of doing but my fingers hurt now

1. Because of their longevity, they've played in the pl as youngsters and the natural lack of consistency at that age would lower their stats. I can take similar periods of their careers even though they were perhaps in different leagues.

2. Compare at similar ages that pogba has been with us since he returned.

3. Try to get an overall picture by taking into account other factors like tackling, shooting accuracy, dribbles, etc.

4. I've been cracking my head to think of other central midfielders I can add to the list so will welcome any help with names.",reddevils
1128,1128,1128,Transcript of AWB's First Interview with MUTV (Inside),"AARON WAN-BISSAKA: HIS FIRST INTERVIEW AT UNITED



The England Under-21 international has¬†completed his move from Crystal Palace, becoming Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's second signing of the summer transfer window following¬†the arrival of Wales winger Daniel James from Swansea City¬†earlier this month.¬†
Aaron will wear the no.29 shirt for the Reds - the same number he wore at his former club Palace.¬†
We sat down with the 21-year-old full-back at the Aon Training Complex for an exclusive first interview, in which he describes his feelings about moving to Old Trafford, discusses his development to date, explains his experience of playing against United and gives a message to the supporters.
Aaron, the deal is done! How does it feel to sign for Manchester United?
‚ÄúYeah I am excited to have finally signed for this team. Every kid wants to play for a team like this. I am grateful and it is an honour to represent this club. I think I will improve every step and learn different things around new team-mates. I think Man United is a big club, a big family, a big fan base, and I think they all stick together and are so tight together.‚Äù

A lot of people are very proud of your achievements in your young career so far and particularly your family. How happy are you that they can be part of this today?
‚ÄúYeah I am really happy. I can see that I have made them proud with this decision and where I have come from, how the journey started, and that makes me kick on and carry on. We stick together and we make decisions on everything. I personally think they know what is right for me and that is the decision I will make. It‚Äôs a good moment, especially for where we have come from, you know this tough journey up until now. It‚Äôs a good feeling.‚Äù

How did you transition from being a winger to one of the most highly-rated full-backs in England?
‚ÄúI think it started with a formation really, you know with wing-backs, and I was playing on the wing back then but we had to play with wing-backs so that is how I got used to it and got the feel of it. From that I enjoyed it and that is how it really all got started.‚Äù

When you were growing up, what sort of things were you trying to develop in your game and were there any players in particular you looked up to? You started out as a winger, right?
‚ÄúI started out as a striker. Growing up, I used to look at Thierry Henry and I just really wanted to do stuff that he did in the Premier League. That encouraged me to push on and try to make things happen.‚Äù

One of our former players Wilf Zaha has spoken about how hard it was to train against you. What was it like training against him and did you learn stuff about your own game?
‚ÄúYeah that is when I realised my actual strengths, from playing against him. It was not easy and it was always a challenge, but at the same time it helped me and made me realise what it is to play against players like him in the Premier League.‚Äù

Your one-on-one defending is unbelievable and you have got that nickname ‚ÄòSpider‚Äô. Tell us about that‚Ä¶ 
‚Äú'The Spider' is about the range and length of my legs when I'm lunging to tackle the ball. That's where the nickname comes from.‚Äù


What would you say are your best attributes as a player?
‚ÄúI would say dribbling, speed and tackling.‚Äù

You have played against United before so what was it like to play against Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and everybody else?
‚ÄúUnited [at Selhurst Park] was my second game in the Premier League and the game wasn‚Äôt going to be easy for me, I knew that. So with me I had to just concentrate and at the same time it was good to play against these players. These are superstars. I learned a lot from that game, playing against them, which has helped me in my development.‚Äù

Have you spoken to Ole and what did he say to you about Manchester United?
‚ÄúYeah I have spoken to him and he has told me how he feels about me. Ole has reassured me about his plans, what he is going to do with the team. That is something I want to be a part of. It was the gaffer‚Äôs decision and his plan to rebuild, and to bring the team back to where it is supposed to be. I wanted to be a part of that plan.‚Äù


You kept a clean sheet at Old Trafford last season ‚Äì what do you remember from that experience?

‚ÄúThat was my first time there. I couldn‚Äôt believe that stadium! As I said in one of the interviews back then, it was one of the best ones I have played at, for its size, the pitch, the fans and the noise. The atmosphere is always loud.‚Äú

How much are you looking forward to playing there in the red of United?
‚ÄúI am looking forward to it. I am excited and I can‚Äôt wait to get 

Finally, do you have a message for the fans who are excited to see you play for United?
‚ÄúI just want to say thanks for welcoming me to this amazing club, I can‚Äôt wait to see you and get started. I think it is an honour to represent this club and I can‚Äôt wait to engage with the fans. I have seen the support they give in every game. This club is known for winning trophies and I want to be a part of that, to win my first. I can see that the fan base is huge and they support the team through thick and thin. I am going to give everything for the club and for the fantastic fans and I can‚Äôt wait to get started.‚Äù",reddevils

Heard something from your butcher?

Dave from Marketing got loose lips after his second WKD blue?

Did Karen tell you some juicy gossip?

Share it here and here alone. The transfer daily threads will now be for Journalists only.

Note: this is the wild west. We aren't policing a thing here, believe who you believe at your own risk. Reddit and subreddit rules about general behaviour do apply though.

**********

We specifically are light-handed on moderating in this thread because the idea is so we can have a bit of fun. Folks can post almost anything they want and you can go full muppet about the newest social media post someone has liked.

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

Have fun doing what you're doing, and discuss the anonymous ITKs legitimacy all you want, but targeting individuals, and/or haranguing / harassing members of our subreddit is a no-no.

********

""Turf wars"" are not cool. We keep two separate threads (Muppet Thread + Transfer Thread) so everyone has somewhere to go and discuss transfers.

We do **NOT** want to see division within our community about ""look at the nerds in the nerd thread"" or ""look at the idiots in the dummy thread"".

We will be cracking down on this kind of stuff as it just creates division within the community. We understand that a lot of it is intended to be harmless joking but it always starts to spiral out of control

Read about the Liverpool fixing scandal in 1915 which was very interesting. Also got some chills in the Munich corner (RIP you legends)

I can‚Äôt help but notice that the stadium seems like it‚Äôs in dire need of upgrades from the painting to the roofs. Also would it be possible to expand it towards the eastern side? I feel like that‚Äôs the only side the expansion would be plausible but maybe locals can chime in

1160,1160,1160,Those who aren't Anti Glazer... Why? [Serious],"Morning / Afternoon / Evening all...

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a few discussions this past week or so on this sub, with several people supporting the Glazers and falling for main stream media was one phrase that was thrown at me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm personally anti-glazer. I don't think they're horrid people, I just think they're bad for the club, they came in and took loans against the club to finance a deal for us which left us with ¬£750m of debt and interests that compound with that.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore to that, they're more concerned of commercial deals and income to line their own pockets than keep United at the top (where I believe we belong). However in retaliation to this I often get people point out large sums paid for certain players, ie Pogba and now AWB. To which I think this is where people forget we have revenue numbers of close to \~¬£600m annually, I believe the money we spend on transfers in relation to revenue is closer to the bottom of the premier league table rather than the top. (Will search for source). On top of this, I think all transfers are made with sales in mind, or of high priority rather than purely footballing terms.

&amp;#x200B;

They also pay themselves in dividends of silly amounts for in my opinion doing next to nothing for the club.

&amp;#x200B;

But the reason I ask here as I have, I'm not in a blind rage about the Glazers, I have the figures on it I've researched myself and see very little positive footballing wise, (Commercially they've signed a genius in woodward and that shouldn't be forgotten.) But that for me is it, but if there are things I'm missing that people believe mean they're better than most of us give credit for, I genuinely would like to know.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit - Just wanted to make this absolutely clear, I don't want any of this to turn into some crappy slag match.

Edit 2 - Congrats everyone, lots of different opinions and no name calling.",reddevils
1161,1161,1161,Preventing a couple of good players from leaving the club.,"Some people would be of the opinion as to allow the players to leave if they want to without considering factors such as the importance they've played in preventing the club from a total breakdown. The players in question are of course De Gea , Pogba and Lukaku. 

De Gea wants to leave because he has lost the belief that we want to compete to be one of the best in the world as we were before and also because of the pay disparities between him and Sanchez (please correct me if I'm wrong). He wants his salary to be in terms of what Sanchez receives and the reason behind this is that he's been the best player of the club for quite some time. Agreeing to his wage demands may seem unreasonable but I think the club does need to find a way or another to make him stay. The obvious reason being his World class performances otherwise which we would have been placed much lower on the table.
His boots will be extremely difficult to fill in a short time and personally it would be too much for me to take if both Herrera and De Gea left the club in the same window. Also not to mention that he has been a complete professional handling other stuffs (like his failed transfer to Real Madrid). He stay put and gave his best each time we stepped on the field.

As for Pogba we know that he's a World class talent and our former Academy player as well. He may want to make a move to Juventus or Real Madrid stating different reasons but one of the reasons could be that he too doesn't believe in the club given its current state. I was led to consider this opinion since he said that he wanted a 'new challenge' which doesn't make a lot of sense. And also the fact that he had more contribution that all the other players in all aspects of the game. Also he's very unlikely to leave because he's far too expensive for the suitors. So I guess his opinion could change in a season if we can produce some good football next season and qualify for the Champions league. After all he is one of our own(referring to the academy again)

As for Lukaku I don't have a lot of inputs. I admire the player, but the statement disrespecting our manager was just to much. And I guess his replacement will be easier to find that the other two who could be potentially replaced by maybe a new signing. Also I expect Rashford to improve which he will and Lukaku's transfer would also allow Greenwood more time on the pitch. I see it as a win - win situation.",reddevils

Full text follows:

\-----------------------

When charting the dizzying ascent of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, there really is only one place to begin. The day that altered a young Crystal Palace winger‚Äôs career path is well chronicled but worth recounting given how transformational it has proved.

A Thursday morning first-team training session in late 2016 and Kevin Keen, the then first-team coach, calls for a few under-23 players to make up the numbers. With the under-23 right back injured, Wan-Bissaka gets the call. Not only is the 18-year-old asked to play out of position, but he is set with the unenviable task of marking perhaps the Premier League‚Äôs most devastating winger, Wilfried Zaha.

Time and again, Zaha runs at the callow, makeshift right back, to no avail. ‚ÄúI can remember Wilf \[Zaha\] getting really frustrated,‚Äù Keen recalls. ‚ÄúLike you see in a Premier League game when he gets kicked, and he has a moan and gets the hump. He wasn‚Äôt used to a young boy coming over in training and not being able to get by him.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

The following week, Keen asked for Wan-Bissaka again. Andros Townsend, this time, was shackled impressively. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how he does it,‚Äù Zaha said. ‚ÄúYou may go past him, but he always manages to get a last ditch tackle in.‚Äù

Two and a half years and only 42 Premier League appearances later, Wan-Bissaka is on the verge of a ¬£50 million transfer to Manchester United, which will make the 21-year-old the most expensive defender in the club‚Äôs history. Subject to a medical, a five-year deal, which is worth about ¬£80,000 a week to the player, is likely to be wrapped up by the weekend.

‚ÄúIn the time I‚Äôve been in football,‚Äù Richard Shaw, the Palace under-23 manager, says, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen anyone go from learning a new position, to playing his first three games in the Premier League against Tottenham, Manchester United and Chelsea and coming through with flying colours, to playing his first full season, and being worth this amount of money. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to get your head around.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Wan-Bissaka grew up in New Addington, Croydon, a little over five miles from Selhurst Park. Like many of the talented young players who have emerged from south London in recent years, his skills were honed in cage matches with friends, or on Walton Green, the sloping grass park near his house, where he played with his older brother, Kevin, and children from his estate.

Aged six, Wan-Bissaka had joined Junior Elite, the grassroots youth club Kevin also played for. ‚ÄúHe was a centre forward with us,‚Äù Colin Omogbehin, the club‚Äôs founder, says. ‚ÄúHe had a lot of natural talent, he was top scorer every year. But having said that, he was always willing to work hard. And very humble. Quiet. Shy, almost. But he came alive on the football field, and took no prisoners.‚Äù

It was Omogbehin, who was a coach in Palace‚Äôs academy and now works for Fulham, who advised the Eagles to sign Wan-Bissaka, aged eleven. Doubts about his attitude and application surfaced on a number of occasions and at 14 it took an intervention from his father, Ambrose, to remind him of the need to avoid distractions and bad influences.

&amp;#x200B;

On a couple of occasions, Shaw recalls, Wan-Bissaka failed to show, or turned up late, for games or training. ‚ÄúHe had a few issues,‚Äù Shaw says. ‚ÄúThere were times where he was influenced by other guys. He was in a boisterous group. They weren‚Äôt shy, as you can imagine, coming from south London. And they were close friends. He went to school with them all. It was hard work. People said, ‚ÄòMaybe we need to move him on ‚Ä¶‚Äô But we persevered. I knew that one day things would click, and he‚Äôd get it. And by God, he got it.‚Äù

In 2016, Shaun Derry, the former Palace midfielder and then the manager of Cambridge United, piloted a scheme where Palace‚Äôs academy prospects were invited to train with the Sky Bet League Two club to experience the realities of life outside the Premier League, with a view to a possible loan move. Wan-Bissaka and Noor Husin, now at Notts County, were the first to do so.

‚ÄúThe idea was for them to see a League Two facility: the food, the gym, one training kit you have to take home and wash at night,‚Äù Derry, who also coached a 14-year-old Wan-Bissaka in Palace‚Äôs academy, says. ‚ÄúIt was taking them out of the comfort zone of Premier League life. At that moment, Aaron wasn‚Äôt ready to leave London and come to Cambridge, where we were fighting for our lives.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

There were bumps on the road to becoming Europe‚Äôs most resolute defender, too. Shaw recalls the first time Wan-Bissaka played at right back for Palace‚Äôs under-23s. ‚ÄúIt was a 2-2 draw against Charlton \[Athletic\],‚Äù Shaw says. ‚ÄúHe struggled at times, positioning-wise. One of the goals was his fault because the ball got played inside him. But we just kept persevering with him.

‚ÄúWe knew he had those, what we call, ‚ÄòGo-go gadget legs‚Äô. When he had played as a winger he always tracked back and was very good defensively. The big thing for us was his defensive positioning. He‚Äôs got the ability going forward ‚Äî people have not seen the best of him yet.

‚ÄúBut the main thing is ‚Äî and I‚Äôve heard people saying, ‚ÄòI knew Aaron was going to be a player since he was two years old, in nappies‚Äô, I don‚Äôt buy all that ‚Äî Aaron has helped Aaron. Dave \[Reddington, the Palace first-team coach\] and I have helped him along the way. But he embraced it. If we said, ‚ÄòAaron, we‚Äôre going outside \[to do some extra work\] at two o‚Äôclock‚Äô, he said ‚ÄòYeah‚Äô. Didn‚Äôt even question it.

&amp;#x200B;

A month before his debut against Tottenham Hotspur in February 2018, thanks to a first-team injury crisis, Wan-Bissaka had spoken with Roy Hodgson, the Palace manager, about going on loan to a League Two club. Hodgson told Wan-Bissaka he was part of his plans but only 18 months on, he must now plan for life without him.

Shaw insists that Wan-Bissaka is equipped for a career at Old Trafford. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a guy who just gets on with life,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAfter every game I text him to say, ‚ÄòWell done, keep working hard.‚Äô He always says, ‚ÄòYep, I will‚Äô. Whoever he‚Äôs playing for, I‚Äôll say the same. That‚Äôs what got him here.

‚ÄúIf Aaron goes to Manchester United, a World Cup, anywhere, he won‚Äôt change.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll take everything in his stride.‚Äù

Perisic: This saga is one we have discussed often, especially as Inter has come looking for Lukaku. Inter tried to dick us around, we put our foot down and rejected Mou's desire to bring him in. Worked out for us. An older player coming off a solid World Cup, but nothing spectacular, especially at the price. Could have been a very regretful signing for us.

Morata: Even though Lukaku hasn't really panned for us, it is not hard to believe that we made out better than Chelsea in this saga. The red haired devil from Madrid looked certain to sign for us, and would solve our crisis up top. Looking back, it is very doubtful he would have. Playing within a superior Chelsea squad, he couldn't get it done. How would he have fared within this mess?

Leon Bailey: I was super excited about this potential transfer. Thought he was a future world class winger and could have solved our huge hole on the right side. It now looks like I was ***very wrong.*** The press speculated a big money move could be coming from us in the winter of 2017-18 and the summer of 2018, with Arsenal and other clubs looking at him too, as he had a strong 2017-2018 season for Leverkusen, Bailey never elevated his game this season and honestly regressed.",reddevils

1195,1195,1195,"ICYMI: A complete Manchester United-focused summary of tonight's BBC 5 Live Sport transfer show, featuring David Ornstein + Statman Dave","For those who are unaware and perhaps intrigued by some of the quotes that have just started doing the rounds online, from 20:00 - 21:30PM UK time tonight, BBC Radio 5 had their Live Sport Transfer discussion show, and Manchester United were a prominent topic of discussion for the panel, which featured Charlie Adam, BBC's David Ornstein, the Telegraph's Sam Wallace and our very own Statman Dave. I thought I would provide a quick summary of the key points for anyone who missed out and doesn't want to dig through an hour and a half of the transfer thread, so here goes:

----------------------------------


- The initial topic of discussion, as I'm sure you're all aware of by now, is that Aaron Wan-Bissaka is expected to become a Manchester United player imminently, now that we've agreed on a transfer fee valuation of ¬£45 million + ¬£5 million in bonuses with Crystal Palace. Ornstein once again confirmed that AWB flew into Manchester today by private jet (congratulations to the resident muppets of r/reddevils who successfully tracked the right flight). The announcement of a 5-year deal is expected to take place tomorrow following a medical.

- In more interesting news, the next United piece of discussion turned to our search for a new centre-half, with Ornstein and the panel confirming it to be a priority signing this summer. Two key pieces of information relating to this CB search followed:

- The first is Tier 1 confirmation from David Ornstein that Manchester United were not only one of the clubs interested in signing Matthijs De Ligt, but the *only* club to have tabled a ""serious contract offer"" to the Dutchman at the time of his last update from sources. However, Ornstein also followed up by stating that De Ligt rejected this same offer. One thing that hasn't been mentioned in some of partial quotes floating around on the internet is that Ornstein said he expects this situation will change over time, which could mean that we submit a new offer or that rival clubs come through with their own deals. As far as I'm aware, this is the first time a British Tier 1 source has confirmed our interest and bid for De Ligt. (u/seaders has kindly provided me with the actual audio for this section, you can listen here: https://streamable.com/43ko0)

- Another centre-half who is confirmed to be a clear target for us is Leicester's Harry Maguire. Ornstein explained that the Englishman is involved in a straight fight between Manchester City and Manchester United, but crucially also stressed that Leicester are not desperate to sell Maguire, and would only do so if their valuation of ¬£75 million was met. Ornstein implied that both City and United are reluctant to meet this valuation, and neither club has submitted an offer near this amount yet.

- The Telegraph's Sam Wallace says that we are making a move for Lyon's 15-year old wonderkid striker Rayan Cherki. This is presumably another attempt by Nicky Butt to substantially strengthen our academy.

- Statman Dave mentioned that we were one of the clubs interested in Tanguy Ndombele, but that he will be going to Spurs this summer.

- Amidst rumours of Liverpool being interested in our target Bruno Fernandes, David Ornstein crucially mentioned that the Scousers will be having a ""low-key"" summer this year, with no intention to splash big money on names such as Lille's Nicolas Pepe or Lyon's Nabil Fekir. If this information is true, it sounds like we have a free run at Bruno.

- Kalidou Koulibaly is of interest to both Manchester United and City. However, Statman Dave and Ornstein stated that Napoli don't have an intention to sell him this summer. The signing of Manolas does NOT change this, with the two seen as the first-choice centre-back pairing for the Italians this upcoming season.

- Finally, David Ornstein tantalisingly concluded the programme by telling viewers to keep an eye on Sampdoria CB Joachim Andersen, as it is expected that he'll be making a move to the Premier League this summer. Andersen was linked with us last summer, and given our search for a CB it's possible that we'll be in for him again. This update concluded the show.

--------------------------------------------------------


#TL:DR: AWB confirmed, multiple CBs being pursued (De Ligt, Maguire, Koulibaly and Joachim Andersen), Liverpool aren't in for Bruno Fernandes, Lyon academy star Cherki pursued by our academy.",reddevils

Hopefully this isn‚Äôt a complete bore but if it is then, well... you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôre not an accountant...

A players fee is almost always paid in instalments but the instalments don‚Äôt really matter from an accounting point of view because all clubs will use accrual accounting. The instalments matter from a cashflow perspective only.

From an accounting point of view, when a club buys a player it‚Äôs basic ledger entries. Let‚Äôs make up an example: we buy Pogba for ¬£90m, tie him to a 5 year contract and the instalments are ¬£40m up front and ¬£25m a year for two more years. When the purchase happens the following occurs:

‚Äò-¬£40m Cash (Upfront instalment)

+¬£90m Asset (Pogba‚Äôs cost to us (accounting principles state an asset should be the lower of cost or net realisable value)

+¬£50m Liability (the remaining instalments we owe)

When the next year rolls around and the next instalment is paid:

‚Äò-¬£25m Cash

-¬£25m Liability

The same occurs for the final ¬£25m instalment.

Those entries deal with all the cashflows and anticipated cashflows.

Now here‚Äôs the part that no article can seem to get right. Amortisation of a players value over the life of their contract...

Pogba is an asset to us and his value is initially at cost. However, he has a contract with us and, if he chooses not to renew, can leave for free at the end of his contract. As a result, we need to follow the principles of accounting that state that we have to amortise his value straight line for each year of his contract to account for this ‚Äúloss of value‚Äù as we move closer to the expiration of his contract.

So on OUR balance sheet, after one year, he will be worth ¬£72m to us (¬£90m / 5 years = ¬£18m reduction in value). Whilst this is a non-cash entry it‚Äôs really quite important as the ¬£18m reduction on our balance sheet affects our bottom line. This is amortisation in a nutshell. It‚Äôs the equivalent of depreciation but for intangible/financial assets.",reddevils
1231,1231,1231,Why this transfer window isn‚Äôt a disaster (yet) and why there is hope for muppets like me. A timeline of transfers.,"Like everyone else on this sub I have slowly let the muppetry over take my very being and as a result I have decided to look for any sign of hope.   

Below I have listed every incoming transfer after SAF retired and the date that each transfer was announced.  

Before we get to the list a couple of notes:  

1) You will notice that Mata, Vald√©s and Sanchez are not included on the list due to the fact they were signed during January transfer windows.  

2) Since Fergie retired we have completed 22 transfers, only 5 of which were announced at this point in the transfer window (25th June).  

3) This data is not completely applicable to this transfer window due to the fact most of the transfers on the list were completed when the English transfer window ended at the end of August instead of the current deadline on the 9th of August.  

Remember it‚Äôs the hope that kills you. Here is the list - 


7th May - Memphis Depay  
7th June - Varela  
7th June - James  
8th June - Bailly  
10th June - Lindelof  
26th June - Herrera  
27th June - Shaw  
1st July - Zlatan  
2nd July - Mkhitaryan  
10th July - Lukaku

Share it here and here alone. The transfer daily threads will now be for Journalists only.

Note: this is the wild west. We aren't policing a thing here, believe who you believe at your own risk. Reddit and subreddit rules about general behaviour do apply though.

**********

We specifically are light-handed on moderating in this thread because the idea is so we can have a bit of fun. Folks can post almost anything they want and you can go full muppet about the newest social media post someone has liked.

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

Have fun doing what you're doing, and discuss the anonymous ITKs legitimacy all you want, but targeting individuals, and/or haranguing / harassing members of our subreddit is a no-no.

""Turf wars"" are not cool. We keep two separate threads (Muppet Thread + Transfer Thread) so everyone has somewhere to go and discuss transfers.

We will be cracking down on this kind of stuff as it just creates division within the community. We understand that a lot of it is intended to be harmless joking but it always starts to spiral out of control

1252,1252,1252,The Glazers,"To preface, I understand that this is going to be heavily down-voted so it doesn't really affect me.  


I'm here to tell you why the Glazer's **aren't** actually bad owners of Manchester United.  


There seems to be a bandwagon, tribal, outrage culture surrounding 'the Glazers' and how we want #Glazersout. In fact, the recent trends indicate that the Glazers must be committing heinous crimes against football/humanity/your life.

  
They aren't.  


Using statista, and an update of the current revenue from Man Utd, it can be noted that Manchester United have generated around ¬£6.5B in revenue in the last 10 years, and since the glazers arrived, around ¬£7B in Revenue.  


There is a graph floating around talking about how the Glazers are siphoning money into their own debt. It labels 'reported net debt' and shows a figure of around ¬£500m - this is not the same sort of debt as say if you went over in overdraft or if you overspent - this is business debt.   


What can be noted, is that Manchester United is the largest business club in football. I.e. There are other teams, most notably Wolves, PSG and Manchester City that have ownership injections of money. This is fundamentally *bad* for the football economy - this is the sort of thing that puts the prices of players from max ¬£80m to 300+ in a short space of time.  


Manchester United is run a little bit differently. They generate their own revenue and feed that back into the club. Now, the consensus seems to be that the Glazers are taking money from the club and not investing much back in; they have invested net ¬£666m (the devil's number) back into the club; this is not gross spend (total spend without sales)

&amp;#x200B;

So, Manchester United is run like a business. The Glazers are running Manchester United like a business...in football this shouldn't be considered a bad thing. There seems to be a glorification of sugar daddies in football, as if it would solve life's problems.  


'Why can't we spend ¬£75m on Maguire and just leave it?'

Well, that is relative to the market yes, this isn't something we were saying even 5 years ago. ¬£75m would have been the third most valuable player ever.  


Sugar Daddies are what is fundamentally *wrong* with football. Just pumping money into the economy, as people know, causes massive inflation. If you make more money, your money is worth less. So, in order for the Glazers to keep up, they have to borrow. This is where the debt is in play. This debt is more like a mortgage. It's there, it's not intrusive and putting money from your business to pay the business debt to retain assent leverage is *not* a bad thing.  


It seems very much that people are scaremongering, bandwagoning to get the Glazer's out because they think they should 'just spend the money' to keep up, in an already fragile market. This is a poor business decision, it would not only affect the club but also the entire football economy. If you have 6 huge spenders every year and it gets more and more and more each passing season, it's going to cause a market crash, where the value of players goes down. Suddenly, the only teams staying afloat are the Sugar daddy teams like PSG, City, Wolves etc - it's a very bad event waiting to happen.  


Yes we want the Glazers to invest, and so far, going all guns blazing and splashing 175m+ on players is a little absurd to just accept as a rightful thing.  


A football club the size of united is not some strange vanity project, it's a functioning business.

1271,1271,1271,I'm hoping to go to my first ever match at OT,"Hey guys,

I live in Australia and will be making my first trip to the UK in August for a mates wedding just outside of London.

We're in London from the 9th until the 19th of August and it just so happens that the opening match against Chelsea at OT is on the 11th! A livelong dream can be fulfilled!

So, what I wanted to ask some of you more experienced lads is how I'm best to go about this?

I've just signed up as a United Member which from my understanding gives me the options to buy tickets right from the club itself once they go on sale - however, I've got 3 mates who are coming so we'll need 4 tickets.

I've also found this website:  [https://www.thomascooksport.com/event/Manchester-United-v-Chelsea/15276](https://www.thomascooksport.com/event/Manchester-United-v-Chelsea/15276) and they seem to do a pretty well priced match ticket + accommodation package for all of us. Is this sort of website worth using or are they a ripoff?

Also, I need to do an OT tour while I'm there, so I'm thinking the Monday morning after the match would be best as we won't get in to Manchester until the Sunday morning after the bucks party in Edinburgh the night before.

1292,1292,1292,How Ronaldo played and was before all his extraordinary goal achievements,"For the last few years he became a severe goal scorer and his game play changed as a result, but i came across videos of him when he was still ""that"" player that gave us that excitement that unkown part of his play this is just a personal view which im sure will be shared by millions and it brought back so many memories of genius that we have missed since 2009 imo,i won't really go into his superb goal record as its always talked of but instead the part many forget or simply dont know. Ill try and keep it short but this is Ronaldo so will be difficult. 

Im almost 31 and i remember when we signed him, and straight away we all like so like the knock off Brazilian Ronaldo? Good luck, his first few years he was this show boat player with no end product but brought excitement to us, had briliant skills that often failed, brilliant dribbling, but lacked the final third, didn't realy score alot but we didn't know what was to come, he was very unpredictable but effective as he would cause problems. But all this made all fans jump from seats be it home or at grounds, his step overs, his cut backs, his sprint speed, his first touch was like second nature even at 18 odd he didnt even think about it as he knew it was good compared to say lukaku, his frustrations when he failed was because he knew he, we knew he was capable of so much more, but not once did he collapse and give up he kept trying and trying till he done right, but still made us happy watching him play because it was fun, all the cheers from crowds of a simple flick, run, step over, cut back, back heel etc. One of his first call ups to Portugal he lost ball in opposition box but ran all way back to win ball but concedes penalty showed his hunger and desire to win, game vs millwall fa cup final which he scored in but he played well with tricks and flicks where Dennis wise fouls him, wise spits on his own hand and puts on Ronaldos face! Did Ronaldo moan? Yes, did he give up? Hell no. 

For me the turning point was rooney vs Ronaldo and the red card, following season he changed, he had bulked up alot, mentality changed and its like he went up levels, his dribbling was effective, started making passes, became stronger, more aware, the boos from other fans actually made him better, then he became the main man, before he went missing in key games, but at 23 or so he turned up, we were in a way being run by a guy at 23 /24 who we knew could do something to step up and outshine anyone.

2006/07 season till 09 imo he was unplayable, no one came near him, he became the go to guy for utd, this is where the goals started coming in, he became effective, match winning, so many memories, the run and goal vs fulham, pompey free-kick, arsenal free-kick/rooney Ronaldo counter, pompey long range, so many key games where he didnt even score. 

07/08 we win title and champions league, he was this monster who coudnt be stopped, goals went up severely at 42, scored 2 goals a game for 3 games running, and this wasn't even his peak, he was the best in the world here, messi wasnt compared to him then, utd fans were mesmerized by this talent by now Brazilian Ronaldo wasnt compared to him either, we relied on him hugely here, that briliant goal vs porto, the header vs Roma, granted we had such a good team then but still Ronaldo stood out. 

Moves to real madrid where we all know what happend, but the years before this was imo his fun years that brought us so much joy to fans that we haven't had since he left, i feel as a fan i watched him from this kid who had talent but needed that guidance and for me, fergie was so crucial to his development, that maybe just maybe he woudnt of been this Ronaldo without fergie? From a kid at 18 to 34 we all been there we all watched him transform to a beast of a player who seems to me takes everything serious when it comes to being the best possible, he worked to become the best and to be one of 2 best for over 10 yrs is something i won't see in my lifetime i also believe messi and Ronaldo needed eachother to push otherwise there is no one else to keep them on their toes. 
 
Two reasons i wanted to write this 1 the old vidoes, 2 my nephew's always say Ronaldo the goal scorer and any skills moves are associated with neymar etc many younger fans wont remember or know the Ronaldo before his goals but that's the Ronaldo i always remember, the joy, excitement and so on for me, he worked to be the best and broke so many records along the way that im glad i seen him all the way, i assume retirement is on cards soon? But in 20 years or more ill talk of him and say i remember it all, i was there he was the best player i seen, the consistency is unheard of from say 21 till now he turns up most players peaked for few years he got better and better and im certain won't see another like him while im still alive, he also turned up for his national team where in game vs Sweden for the play off for world cup he got an applaud from zlatan which says it all, or vs Spain in world cup, how many times have we said it about him thats why for me the greatest player i ever seen. 

I have few videos which ill share, no music just pure commentary to remember it all. As long as least 1 fan remembers just like me it will be worth it. Iv kept it short as possible otherwise this would turn into a book.

1294,1294,1294,Should Angel Gomez get a loan after Mata's contract extension?,"I don't get to watch much of the academy but I understand that Gomez is a player of the same qualities that Mata, not only from the physical aspect but also in the technical qualities and playmaking/creation as a number 10 player.

Angel didn't get a lot of times the past 2 seasons and seen Juan would be with us for at least 2 more years maybe is the right time for him to get a loan and start having more playing time under his belt and when the times come to play regularly he isn't just an academy prospect.

I don't think that a bottom table club would suit him, since most play very defensive, and probably a dominant team in the Championship would be better for his development

What are your thoughts on this?

EDIT: I don't think that in the end Ole is gonna rotate the team that much between all 4 competitions and that the youngsters won't going to play in one or two of those tournaments as starters. If we don't sell players and bring 3 to 4 (rumored) more then the first team squad is going to have a lot of players in quantity

Having said that we did have a purple patch during the start of Ole's reign and were clearly the best team in the premier league for about 10-12 games.

So even if we cannot replace all the holes during this window we can expect a few players to step up (Mctominay showed great potential, hopefully Fred settles down and the youngsters will always be hungry to perform). A long shot but maybe even Axel could try to cement his centre back spot.

If this does work out the team could easily qualify for the Champions league even if they don't perform well at the transfer market.",reddevils

Positives 
- Great link up play

- Good off ball movement
- Good instinct and movement inside the box
- Retained possession well
- Good at winning fouls

Negatives

- All long shots have been off target
- No successful dribbles
- Inconsistent first touch
- Tendency to pass to teammates in bad positions
- Cannot maintain high intensity play for long periods
- Deteriorates physically in second half 

Comments:
It would seem from the first two games that Sanchez has struggled to find himself in positions out wide, he has shown a complete unwillingness to engage with athletic defenders on the dribble opting to retain possession instead. Sanchez is also struggling to take the ball in tight spaces and performs much better when he has 5 yards to settle on the ball. Has performed much better when receiving the ball in the center areas of the pitch where he has quickly tried to engage his striker with a through ball or link up play. Sanchez has also looked good as a secondary option in the box when receiving crosses and has favoured a late run off of the fullback.",reddevils

So as you can see, United can sign a player from nothing. It all happens pretty quickly, and it can all go silent for a few days such as Matic. So please do not fret. Our Tier 1s rarely break news, it's usually other team's/country's

Heard something from your butcher?

Dave from Marketing got loose lips after his second WKD blue?

Did Karen tell you some juicy gossip?

Share it here and here alone. The transfer daily threads will now be for Journalists only.

Note: this is the wild west. We aren't policing a thing here, believe who you believe at your own risk. Reddit and subreddit rules about general behaviour do apply though.

**********

We specifically are light-handed on moderating in this thread because the idea is so we can have a bit of fun. Folks can post almost anything they want and you can go full muppet about the newest social media post someone has liked.

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

Have fun doing what you're doing, and discuss the anonymous ITKs legitimacy all you want, but targeting individuals, and/or haranguing / harassing members of our subreddit is a no-no.

""Turf wars"" are not cool. We keep two separate threads (Muppet Thread + Transfer Thread) so everyone has somewhere to go and discuss transfers.

1415,1415,1415,Back The Policy,"Not a lot of positivity surrounding Man Utd at the moment so I wanted to raise a point on our season ahead and transfer targets which I‚Äôm happy to see.

Now obviously it‚Äôs gutting being in the Europa League but what it does mean is 10+ Guaranteed games vs relatively easy European opposition. It also sets the expectation lower on those European nights and actually takes more pressure off of achieving top 4 through the league as you can qualify by winning it.

It provides a great basis if used correctly to bed in the young talent currently at Man Utd. It also finally gives us a chance to take a risk on signing 18-23 year olds with potential high upsides. 

Daniel James is a great illustration of that, I don‚Äôt expect much from him in the league this season but this year the Europa league should set him up perfectly to be a first team player next year. I also see the same opportunity for Dalot to get some regularity playing in that RB position. If AWB signs then we have another young player who will get similar exposure to what he had at Palace and not PSG/Juve/Barca, which will be great for his development.

I would like to see us chase after a few more of these players, people like; Gon√ßalo Guedes, Ismaila Sarr, Donny Van de Beek, Declan Rice &amp;amp; Leon Bailey. 

It is kind of key to chase these players now as if we do qualify for CL next year the opportunity will be missed to bed these players in with much more ease.

The opportunity this year is also perfect for McTominay, Chong, Gomes, Greenwood, TFM, Tuanzebe &amp; Pereira as these guys will have games that they can feature in and games where the coaching staff can risk playing them.

Finally it is slightly controversial but I would not mind taking a view this year on the Carabao &amp;amp; FA cup and really use it this season as a platform for growing the youth as well. If we do that along side the Europa I could see us giving the likes of TFM &amp;amp; Chong 10-15 appearances this year.

We specifically are light-handed on moderating in this thread because the idea is so we can have a bit of fun. Folks can post almost anything they want and you can go full muppet about the newest social media post someone has liked.

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

Have fun doing what you're doing, and discuss the anonymous ITKs legitimacy all you want, but targeting individuals, and/or haranguing / harassing members of our subreddit is a no-no.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm almost sure that someone else might done have a comparison like this with greater accuracy and/or more detail.

* The seasons compared are the last Ronaldo one, the last SAF one, and everything since then. The last season was not separated into Mourinho/Ole eras.
* I only included aspects which are directly comparable, with the notable exception being transfers in/out. As these often included youth or reserve players.
* I wanted to include injuries per season, and total days lost. But there wasn't any reliable source for a full breakdown.
* I did not include the top assister, as I really did not want to count goals individually for every season.
* Stats do not tell the whole story, but I found it interesting to look at what is there.
* You'll notice that I didn't highlight certain cells, because the story isn't as clear cut. For example, our record in the 08/09 CL campaign was 6-6-1 on the way to a Final. In the 18/19 season, it was 4-1-5 which ended in a Quarter-Final. I could have segregated the matches into group stages and knock-outs, but I simplified it. For now, at least.
* Speaking of CL, any season where we did not participate was labeled the worst. Arrogant? Perhaps. But I have high standards for our team.
* Compiling this took a bit of effort. I assume that there is a whole stat pack available if you cough up the cash. The sources used were the Premier League's official site, WhoScored, and Wikipedia. One or two of these may be prone to errors, but I wasn't looking for an exact science and I am not getting paid for this.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the comparison is far from perfect (I did do stats in my previous job). If the Reddit community likes it, I can proceed to do all the other seasons including our time as Newton Heath. These would probably be in separate tabs by decade. And a special tab comparing teams from different eras. Assuming something like that doesn't already exist.

The only reason David de gea is still at this club is because of a broken fax machine. Ronaldo began engineering his move to real three years before his left. Rooney threatened to go to city. If you want to keep the best players in the world the ambition of the club has to match and it hasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs football, it happens. Swallow the pride,  act like a big club and hold onto him, build a successful future and a lot of things can change in a year. Selling every player who flirts with a move is weak and we have too much deadwood to be focusing on selling one of our only world class talents. Can‚Äôt expect to have world class players want to stay and waste their prime years if the club doesn‚Äôt respect itself enough to invest in a future and structure that is required to be a big club. Real have one down season after here champions leagues and drop 300 mill before July  because they mean business while we can‚Äôt figure out what structure we want as a club. Build it and they will come, and as a club we have built nothing worth coming to. We need to question our hierarchy not the only player we had that made team of the year.
 
This is also the short sided mindset that resulted in us selling players like Memphis and Zaha due to ‚Äúmentality‚Äù only to see them succeed in clubs with an established culture and philosophy. At some point people need to realize it‚Äôs not them; maybe it‚Äôs the club. Too many good players under perform in our badge for us not to question the environment at the club. Juventus, Madrid, Barca, bayern, and all the clubs of our magnitude don‚Äôt struggle with this issue and there‚Äôs a reason for that. It‚Äôs time we hold the people running this club to a higher standard. We need to focus on the root of the problem rather than treating the symptoms.

They're basically guaranteed a CL finish every year regardless of instability and are consistently competing for silverware. It was no secret Hazard wanted to sign for them for ages, and that makes the transfer a lot simpler. RM/Barca have always had the allure as long as I remember and that hasn't changed. Small side point - they've had 6 garbage transfer windows according to their fans, and this summer spree was LONG on the cards. To the point where reporters have said other clubs are waiting for the chain reaction in transfers from Real conducting their business, because signings like Hazard were nailed on for ages.

For United, it's a different situation. Back at the height of our powers under SAF, aside from being hamstrung by the Glazers, SAF was able to get in the players he wanted, without having to try and ""sell a project"" to potential targets. Now, there's massive instability and players (read: wages) need convincing of coming here, over any other top club - and we've seen that clearly with the decimation of our wage structure since SAF left. 

**Player Power**

This also leads to player power and the clusterfuck that is dealing with high powered agents and modern negotiation tactics. Look at players like MLD and Greizz who are able to tease bullshit in the media for months and drag out their decision making - even Barca are falling trap this, so it's definitely a reality for us. Was it Anders or Mata we signed through some hidden broker type people who negotiated on our behalf to get the deal done? From what I've read something similar is happening with Bruno Fernandes. According to reports, other players we're linked with like Rabiot and Tielemans are shopping around for clubs too - they have many offers on the table and we're just one of the pack - again slowing down negotiations.  

**Broadcasting Money**

Then there's the amount of money in the game. With how lucrative TV deals have gotten, quality players are the commodity for clubs, not cash. This is why we see teams like Palace holding out for 50m+ for AWB because what motivation do they have to sell? They know they have one of the most talented players in the league in that position and it's their right to make the transfer as workable for them as possible. Just like it is for us with the potential sale of Pogba/Lukaku etc (i.e. we should absolutely be holding out for top money for them, otherwise fuck off, they stay).

I understand teams like Dortmund have gotten signings across the line quickly - but ask yourself are they players that suit the level Dortmund are looking for (ability, price etc) - and that's why they were able to get them? Or were they going after the best players in the European leagues like we are? They have stability, a defined transfer strategy and a relatively consistent level of club. I'm not so sure it's comparable; I don't think we can be compared to either Dortmund or RM. Look across at the transfer business of the PL top 6 - who else has made so many signings, let alone major ones? Besides Pool and City, everyone else needs a lot of work just like we do.  

**Media**

Last point on this ramble is the media. Times have changed with every single tiny development in a transfer being blown up and spread across the world in seconds, without any thought to the complexity of negotiations, especially in a tough market situation as now (see points above). There's so many reasons for transfers to be slowed, so many factors impacting decisions that making quick deals for the players we REALLY are no longer quick deals. 

Should we just pay what clubs are asking? I get that view and agree somewhat - especially when it kills me how the pigfucker Glazers are siphoning money out of our United, when we should/could use those interest payments to meet asking prices and get deals done. Conversely, where does it end? Today we pay the ¬£75m asking price for AWB because that's what we desperately need now, but how will that impact our next signing, and the one after, and the one after that? Clubs know we'll just pay the asking price, so lets up that United tax some more! No matter what state the business is in, is that sustainable long term? As armchair fans and keyboard warriors it's easy to say so. EDIT: Not to mention the media pressure of ""¬£50mil down the drain"", for every player we overpay for that doesn't perform.

Having said all that, I'm feeling just as impatient and wish we could get these fucking transfers over the line yesterday, because the insane pace of media updates vs the actual reality of real life make these things feel like they've dragged on FOREVER already. Could Ed/Judge etc do better? Fuck yeah, but I don't think that's the only factor at play. Am I chatting shit? Probably. It's easy to overlook points to fit your narrative so please change my mind! Fingers crossed, OGS gets what he needs, to at least have a good crack next season. And then, is given TIME and CONSISTENT BACKING with the proper vision and philosophy, just like Klopp/Pep.

**TLDR Top talent is scarce and money is everywhere. We're not as appealing as we were in the past, and negotiations with rich clubs, agents and players are ever more complex. Our transfer policy/long term strategy is still unresolved and the glazers are parasites.**",reddevils
1485,1485,1485,"An analysis on the 4-4-2 diamond, our transfer dealings and next season.","Looking at our summer activity, I think we can assume that Ole will be looking to adopt a system that is very similar to the one Liverpool played this past season: a 4-4-2 diamond. Although Liverpool's system looks like a 4-3-3 on paper, Firmino drops so deep that it actually functions as a 4-4-2 diamond, with Salah and Mane playing as split strikers who become wingers without the ball. Their system has a few characteristics: high intensity, a high line of engagement, a high line of defense and a very hard working midfield that cover a lot of ground.

Of course, I am not recommending we copy their system like-for-like; we are stronger in some areas and weaker in many others. Our system should be similar in philosophy but different in approach. Below I will list a few key aspects that we must focus on when comparing ourselves to Liverpool.

**1) Strikers must be comfortable out wide**

The real strikers in Liverpool‚Äôs formation are Salah and mane. They are both comfortable out wide and making runs in behind. I think we are somewhat decent in this aspect with martial, Jesse, Rashford, Lukaku and maybe **James**. They must also press well and work hard off the ball

**Resolution**: Martial and Lukaku have to improve on their movement and their work rate The attackers as a whole need a better end product. Jesse and Rashford are basically perfect to play this system and it will play to their strengths. Hopefully, we bring in Sancho but it is not the end of the world if we don't (should we play this system).

**2) Attacking fullbacks, and Trent Alexander Arnold.**

We all know how good Roberson and TAA are in attack. Both have good energy and crossing ability. In comparison, young has been fucking shite going forward and Shaw has been average. We will really need to improve in this aspect and signing AWB is a good start. I don‚Äôt buy AWB‚Äôs supposedly weakness in attack because every fullback will look shite going forward in that palace team. 

I would like to highlight TAA‚Äôs contribution to this Liverpool team. He has a fantastic cross, probably one of the best in the entire league. But what is less talked about is his ability to playmaker. He has the vision and passing ability to basically become a playmaker from the fullback position. It also means he is good both out wide and slightly tucked in towards the middle. He is basically Pep‚Äôs wet dream and is a huge reason why Liverpool can afford to play the midfield they play and still not look toothless. TAA actually missed three matches during that period where they dropped points: Leicester, west ham and Everton. And also the 3-0 defeat at the Camp Nou.

**Resolution**: Shaw and **AWB** need to provide high energy, providing a threat in the final third. Shaw had a decent season but looked really toothless going forward, this needs to be addressed this season. AWB is a former winger and hopefully will get the license to push forward. Dalot will be fantastic in this role against smaller teams.

Of course, we don't expect TAA's level of playmaking from our fullbacks, we have creativity in midfield that they don't: Paul Pogba.


**3) Pressing and the defensive trident**

If you watched the UCL final, Klopp actually completely neutralised Spurs' buildup play with a very different kind of pressing game we have seen from them in the past. They gave Lloris, Alderweireld, and Vertonghen all the time in the world with the ball and pressed their out ball instead. Mane and Salah were constantly on their fullbacks, Firmino in between the defence and midfield lines, Henderson, Gini and Fabinho on the midfield three of Sissoko, Winks, and Eriksen. This resulted in the entire Spurs team being extremely disconnected. Winks, Sissoko and Eriksen were never in the game. The center-backs simply were not given the chance to find them in a good position at all and had to resort to hoofing it forward.

But that's where the Liverpool defensive trident (Fabinho, Van Dijk and Matip) came up absolutely huge. All three are very very good at winning 1v1 duels, both on the ground and in the air. Van Dijk and Matip both came out of the defensive line to win a ball if needed. This meant that Kane never had a chance to hold up the ball to bring someone else into play. This meant that there was a large area of the pitch (the midfield and the line between midfield and defence) where Spurs could not even compete. Poch realised this and started getting trippier and rose on the ball. Their best phases of play all came from either Rose running down the left flank or Trippier hoofing the ball in behind the defensive for Kane, Son, and Alli to run onto. The speed and positioning of Van Dijk and Allison coming off his line meant that this was only semi-successful. Matip and Van Dijk both recover extremely well even when they lose duels, and this meant that their defensive shape never suffered.

**Resolution**: Ole has a huge job to do, drilling a structured and high-intensity press. The work ethic of the entire team also comes into question. Will Martial and Lukaku work as hard as Salah and Mane? We are losing one of our hardest workers in Herrera and work rate in midfield has been a problem for a long time. I believe that Pogba is not lazy and is someone who is highly influenced by those around him (watch him play beside Kante for France). Pogba is absolutely crucial to our team and we should not let him go at any price. He is our best player and our most creative player. Our midfield will be extremely important due to how 'limited' our fullbacks are compared to Liverpool. Hence, we need to sign and field players who work hard, have high energy and also the ability to bring the ball forward. 

**Rabiot** works hard and does well in defense. He is also a great ball carrier and has good passing ability. N'dombele and Lo Celso in comparison, are both slightly more suspect in defensive situations.
**Fernandes** has the technical and playmaking ability to take some of the burden off Pogba. He also works hard and presses well - the closest to Firmino we cant get. Play Fred and McTominay in the pivot instead of Matic. Matic is far too slow and has been very poor on the ball. Jesse will also be decent in the Firmino position.

We also need a defender who is comfortable breaking out the defensive line to win a ball then have the positional sense/awareness/speed to recover. We need **De Ligt/Maguire/KK**, I don't think Dias, Diop or Tuanzebe are good enough yet. Bailly and smalling should be kept. Jones and Rojo should both be binned for obvious reasons.

**Conclusion**

All of our rumored signings point to this being the main formation Ole will adopt this season. De Ligt, Rabiot, AWB, James and Fernandes all fit the type of signings we should be looking for and will represent a fantastic season. Of course, pre-season will be extremely important. The 4-4-2 diamond is a somewhat newish system, and preparation will be key. Ole and the coaching team have a huge task in front of them.

We can only hope Ed is ruthless and smart enough to get us the players we need, and not settle for much poorer choices.",reddevils

1488,1488,1488,[Summer Series] 2019 /r/reddevils Census Results,"Thank you for taking part of this years edition of /r/reddevils' census! We had 1,839 responses over the course of several days.

[Here are the results.](https://imgur.com/a/cfPy4ld)

********************

**Age**

Unsurprisingly, 95.2% of our user base is under the age of 35. What might be somewhat interesting is that 59.5% of the userbase indicated that they were 25 and younger. Here is a [chart showing the break out by age group](https://i.imgur.com/osbAnbv.png) and also an [age distribution graph](https://i.imgur.com/XsG3NgB.png). We do have some older Reds, it is good to see we're not just a rabble of youngsters...just mostly one.

********************

**Gender**

Again, not surprisingly, /r/reddevils is overwhelmingly male. [97.8% of respondents indicated that they were male](https://i.imgur.com/lRwmvSo.png) which translates to [1,799 out of the 1,839 responses](https://i.imgur.com/smsyfZi.png). We do have some ladies here (28) along with some folks who preferred not to say (5) and some folks who marked themselves as Other (7). The others are as follows: three kinds of helicopter (1 Apache attack helicopter, one fighter helicopter, and one regular ol' helicopter), an alpha male (as opposed to a regular male?), a cyborg, a robot unicorn, and a Wookiee. [It appears that our resident Wookie has been here at least since the last census in 2012.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/12dguu/official_2012_rreddevils_census_results/) Good to see you're still around.

********************

**Employment**

[Most of the reds are employed \(71.5% across the Employed, Student Employed, and Self Employed categories\)](https://i.imgur.com/nVE5acT.png). We do have a lot of students here (37.4% across the two student categories) as well. There is one user I am absolutely jealous of though. [One individual](https://i.imgur.com/n7r7aec.png) indicated that they were retired. Enjoy retirement sir/madam. The rest of us have 30-40 years to go it appears.

********************

**Residence**

[The majority of /r/reddevils is UK or US based](https://i.imgur.com/8LYpyrl.png) (29.1% and 28.1%, respectively). Asia (which is overwhelmingly South and Southeast Asia) comes in third place followed closely by the Europe (non-UK). *So much for our American overlords* (don't deport me /u/sauce_murica).

[If we're breaking it down by the regions](https://i.imgur.com/LfqwDpt.png) I arbitrarily put into the census form, UK (England) is the clear winner with 360 members reporting living in England and another 89 specifically saying they are in Manchester. 

********************

**Season Ticketholder/Matches Attended**

Overwhelmingly, [most of us here are not season ticketholders](https://i.imgur.com/I7B1cqg.png) (98%). I did get some feedback that I didn't include an option for ""used to be, have cancelled because we're shit"" so I'll keep that in mind for next time.

[Most folks are unable to attend games](https://i.imgur.com/NS7t2HL.png) as well. We do have some very dedicated individuals who make it out to 31+ games per season. You guys are the real MVP.

******************

**How long have you been following football/Manchester United?**

[We have a lot of folks that are here for the long haul](https://i.imgur.com/olm4LM4.png). Very few have been following either football or Manchester United for 3 or less years. Our recent...bumps in the road...*obviously* did not have a part to play in that.

*****

**How long have you been a subscriber to /r/reddevils and how do you usually access Reddit?**

[We have a lot of new-ish users here](https://i.imgur.com/cKe0Tmk.png), which is expected since we've had two massive growth spurts in the last two years. We've also apparently had some folks who have been on the sub for 20+ years...despite the sub only being 8 years old. Silly of me to let that be an option...

This next bit is probably the most surprising to me. [Based upon the traffic data that Reddit provides](https://i.imgur.com/bkMnpK0.png), I expected a bit more of an even distribution for how folks access the sub. [Based on the census though, it appears that Reddit apps are the most popular by far](https://i.imgur.com/sCr7YF8.png). Now this is just a sample of our userbase so it very may be what the traffic stats are reporting but it appears our more active userbase prefers a Reddit app over anything else. When on desktop though, our active userbase prefers ""Old Reddit"" to ""New Reddit"" by over a factor of 2. Long live Old Reddit.

**Favorite Current Player**

So this is the question most folks vocally said they had problems with...mainly because they couldn't choose since our squad was so shit. [Victor Lindelof is easily the favorite amongst voters though](https://i.imgur.com/zZ4vtmj.png), having amassed right around a quarter of the votes. The much slated Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford come comfortably in second and third, respectively. 

Shout out to the 111 other McTerminator lovers out there!

****

**Favorite All Time Player**

[During the previous census](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/12dguu/official_2012_rreddevils_census_results/), Eric Cantona won the vote with Scholes and Giggsy coming second and third. [In this years edition, Wayne Rooney was the undisputed king of /r/reddevils](https://i.imgur.com/qNUEHjW.png). He is followed by Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Scholes. Eric Cantona dropped to sixth place behind fifth placed Giggsy.

I was really happy to see Park get some love, he came in tenth (tied with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer). To my fellow Koreans/Park lovers out there, it's good to know I'm not alone!

1490,1490,1490,Motivation in sport - a bit of psychology,"Hey all!  


There was [a post on motivation](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/bx2qqo/opinion_team_understanding_is_the_best_motivator/) 10 days ago, courtesy of u/ManUnited02 and I have commented that if you guys want, I can write up a small explanation on the psychology of motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

My background - I have been a competitive judoka for 10 years or so, and have just finished my Psychology Bsc. I have written a 10 page long paper (literature summary) on the motivation in sport, so I'm trying to make a short summary of that here.

&amp;#x200B;

So, motivation is fucking complicated. For starters, **there are at least 32 theories, on how it works** (Ford, 1992). It comes from the latin word ""movere"" which unsurprisingly means ""to move"". And frankly, it is goddamn hard to define. But, all in all, it is the complex of everything that effects behavior - what causes is, what makes it stick, what controls it (Gy√∂mb√©r and Kov√°cs, 2012).

There are a lot of notable motivation theories from a lot of different people, but I'm not going to go into details about them. Sorry,  Freud, Maslow, Bandura and Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi.

To be more specific, I won't really explain any theories in detail. I want this post to be short and easy to comprehend. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, motivation has a lot of factors, people are motivated by a lot of different things. **The main thing is, that there is not one thing that is a better motivator.** While Ryan and Deci argues that when you do stuff for the sake of doing it and do it for yourself (intrinsic motivation), not for the money, the trophies or other extrinsic factors - it is a higher level of motivation, there is no major evidence to suggest that it actually makes you do better. **In fact, even if you do it for the sake of doing it, other extrinsic factors (how much you earn, what the coach thinks, what your family thinks) still effect you.** 

Also, while you will see a lot of comments around the internet, that someone is a mercenary and only does such and such for money, no-one will admit that they only are in it for the money. There is **only one player, who have publicly stated that he did it for the money and nothing else** \- Benoit Assou-Ekotto (former Spurs player) - *""I play football to earn a living and make my life easier.‚Äù‚Ä¶""Yes, I play for the money but then doesn‚Äôt everybody who gets up in the morning and goes to work? They do it to provide for their family.""* (Goaldotcom, 2011).

He was in the PL, while a whole lot of other players, who do it for the sport and are motivated intrinsically, weren't, so as you can see, as long as you are motivated, it doesn't necessarily matter, how you are motivated (although this is only anecdotal evidence, but let's not dwell on it). But, in theory, as you become more and more internally motivated, you are a lot less dependent on other factors (Williams, 2010). So, if you love doing what you do, you will get less demotivated by earning less or winning less trophies.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, as you see, the important factor is that you - as a player - find something that motivates you. And that depends on your personality. Which is again determined by genetics, socialization and a multitude of other factors.**

&amp;#x200B;

**One other factor that is really important, is how much you believe in yourself, that you can achieve the goals you set.** Your self-belief, or self-efficacy determines what kind of goals you will set and if you actually believe that you can and will do them or not. If you don't believe in your skills or in yourself, you are more prone to giving up and not pursuing your goals.

&amp;#x200B;

**How can the coach help?**

While a lot depends on the players, a lot depends on the coach too. There are a lot of stuff the coach can do - but again - I'm trying to be short. The best coaches in general are positive,  communicative, give constructive feedback, make players feel better about themselves and set achievable goals. Threatening players, making them feel negative about themselves and giving negative feedback is generally not something you want in a coach.

There are exceptions though. Sometimes a good-old hair-dryer treatment is what turns the table and some players need really rigid coaches (approaches) to flourish. It all depends on the players' personality.

So - in summary, **the best coaches realize how to motivate each and every player and then do it accordingly. They are harsh and rigid with those, who need that kind of treatment, and are positive and flexible with others.**

One other factor that can benefit the coaches is if they know motivation-theories so they can use them.

&amp;#x200B;

**And a final TL;DR - Motivation depends on a hella lot of stuff, and the best thing a player do is to find out what motivates them and keeps them motivated - and then use it to be motivated. One way isn't necessarily better, than the other. Same with coaches.**",reddevils

1576,1576,1576,Less than a month until opening day. What have United done to fix last seasons problems?,"##Intro
Apologies for the wall of text. Skip to the conclusion for the TL;DR.

If you watched any of last season you'd likely agree it was (with the exception of the few weeks of Solskjaer's honeymoon period) a disaster. It's difficult to imagine quite where and how it could have been worse. By contrast it's fairly simple to identify some reasons *why* it was so bad. Quite a few of these apply to the entire post-SAF period, but I'll be focusing on last season and this.

I've listed a few basic problems, many of which tie into one another. I'll then go over what has been (and is being) done to rectify them*:

1. Toxic Manager.
2. Incompetent planning/player recruitment strategy.
3. Not enough quality at centre-back.
4. No right-sided width.
5. Aging first team right backs.
6. Aging defensive-midfielders.
7. General lack of work-rate and fitness.
8. Wage-structure and ongoing contract negotiations.
9. Problem players.

^* ^Feel ^free ^to ^add ^other ^problems ^as ^you ^see ^them, ^and ^comment ^about ^what ^is ^being ^done ^about ^them.

##1\. Toxic Manager
Mourinho was obviously a poisonous presence at the club toward the end of his tenure, and IMO he made his position untenable and had to go.

One particular memory I'll always have of his reign is of the West Ham away game in late September. Mourinho started with Scott McTominay in central defence. This was, in my view, a fairly blatant act of petulant, vindictive defiance, given that we had Bailly and Darmian on the bench that day. It was a big, childish middle-finger in Ed Woodward's direction. We quickly went behind in the game, and lost 3-1 having been out-competed (something we'd see time and again last season) to the extent that we made Mark Noble look like prime Edgar Davids.

It's clear, though, that Mourinho was never *really* the main problem.

**What has changed/will change?**

We obviously sacked him and brought in Solskjaer, who had a great honeymoon period. However, after a few weeks the hopeful promise of better times ahead was replaced by the realisation that nothing of significance had changed. Ole seemed to fairly quickly abandon his initial positive style of play for a more pragmatic ""Mourinho"" approach, as he began to graso the strengths, weaknesses, and fitness levels (more on that later) of the team he had inherited. We finished the season in pretty abysmal form.

##2\. Incompetent planning/player recruitment strategy
This of course ties into problem 1, because much of the reason for Mourinho's toxicity was born of a lack of respect and backing shown to him by the board, and in particular Ed Woodward who, it's plain to see, is not fit to run the sporting side of the club. Give Mourinho a contract extension, then a few months later refuse to sign his targets? Is it really a surprise he offered up the spiteful team selections and depressing press conferences that he did?

**What has changed/will change?**

Well...nothing so far, and there seems to be little hope anything will be changing on this front this summer. We did hear rumours that the club was looking to appoint an experienced sporting director, but those rumours soon became whispers that ex-players such as Rio Ferdinand and Darren Fletcher were being considered for the job, then faded away entirely. We continue with Woodward making the signings.

The signing of Daniel James (ANOTHER LW!) when we are crying out for a RW is fairly typical of our recent transfer strategy, although in a vacuum it looks like a good value signing. Hopefully it's suggestive of plans to move along some of our high-paid under-performing LWs in the near future.

##3\. Not enough quality at centre-back
Mourinho identified centre-back as a problem. To be fair, anyone watching us could identify centre-back as a problem. He previously brought in Bailly and Lindelof (though how much input he had in those signings is debatable). He discarded Bailly after he showed himself to be a very raw and risky player, and he showed almost as much distrust in Lindelof after his shaky start at United. Lindelof has settled in much better, and looks a decent signing but we need more and better in this area. Mourinho wanted Alderweireld, but the board clearly said no. Toby would have been an expensive, short-sighted, Matic-like signing, but would surely have made us better.

**What has changed/will change?**

Nothing so far this summer (get used to reading that), with not even a solid rumour of anything in this area. This has to be a priority this month, right?

##4\. No right-sided width
It's fine to favour one side of the pitch when you attack, but we have no reliable threat on the right, and haven't had for some number of seasons now. We mainly used Lingard and Mata there, and neither offer actual width on that side, as they look to drift inside with or without the ball. This makes us very predictable, and thus easier to defend against.

**What has changed/will change?**

Again, nothing really. Maybe the AWB signing (more later) allows us to use Dalot as a right winger? I'm not convinced we'll see any better results from the right side this season, and we've heard basically no rumours of any signings in this area.

##5\. Aging first team right-backs
Young started last year quite poorly at RB, but still seemed to fade, and put in some frankly embarrassing performances toward the end of the season. Valencia and Darmian were basically non-factors. Dalot was bought last year, but is a raw prospect rather than the finished article.

**What has changed/will change?**

Well, we allowed Valencia to leave. And then splashed out on AWB. This is a good signing with the potential to be a great one, though I'm not sure it solves our immediate lack of right sided attacking width, as he looks far more accomplished in defence than attack. But at least we signed someone for the first team, FINALLY.

##6\. Aging defensive-midfielders
Mourinho's signing of Matic was an ok, if typically short-sighted one**. Matic followed his good first season with his worst Premier League campaign (not helped by injury). He's functional, but shouldn't be more than a squad player at a club of United's stature, and seems to be on the decline. Herrera has had two good seasons in five years at United (2014/15 and 2016/17).

^** ^It's ^odd ^that ^Ed ^allowed ^this ^signing ^but ^not ^Alderweireld...

**What has changed/will change?**

Nothing helpful so far. We failed to offer Herrera the sort of contract he was holding out for, and he's off to Ligue 1. IMO he's not worth the money he's getting from PSG and, although this will be a blow to the dressing room, it shouldn't be a blow on the pitch provided we sign any decent defensively minded midfielder. Matic is on the books for next season with an option for a further year (which I suggest we don't take).

We needed younger reinforcements here before Herrera's departure. We certainly do now he's gone. Mario Lemina would be a solid if unspectacular replacement for Herrera, but we're going to need a replacement for Matic as well.

##7\. General lack of work-rate and fitness
We were the third laziest team in the Premier League last year behind only West Ham and Cardiff. The clubs we should be seriously competing with are all in the top 9 for distance covered. This is totally unacceptable. Mourinho complained about last year's pre-season preparations being disrupted by the world cup, but other teams had this same problem and dealt with it better, so as the head coach he surely has to take some blame for himself.

**What has changed/will change?**

That remains to be seen. United must simply must work harder next year and must prepare correctly over the next month. This is the one problem I have real hope and expectation will be sorted out.

##8\. Wage-structure and ongoing contract negotiations
We really, really shit the bed when we signed Sanchez. Not only has he been awful since joining, but his bloated contract has torn-up any semblance of a wage-structure and unsettled several players. Guys like De Gea are rightfully thinking that if Sanchez is worth 350k p/w, why aren't they?

**What has changed/will change?**

Well...Rashford just got 5-years 200k p/w. That's a lot for a 21 year-old who has much to prove. For reference, that's the same money De Gea's currently on. He is very valuable to the club as a home-grown player, and hopefully he builds on last year and makes that contract look like a bargain.

We're gonna have to decide what to do with De Gea. His uncertainty over his future must surely have played a role in him having probably his worst full Premier League season. I'd pay him, as he's a World-Class keeper who's likely not yet entered his prime.

Ultimately to settle things down we need to get rid of Sanchez, though that will likely necessitate paying him to play elsewhere.


##9\. Problem players
I'm mainly referring to Pogba and Lukaku here, but you could include others like Martial who's hearts don't appear to be in it.

If we learnt anything from the SAF years it has to be that no player is bigger than the club. You need to identify players who do not want to be here, and you need to have the resolve to get rid of them.

Beckham, Stam, van Nistelrooy, Keane, etc etc. Lots of great players were shown the door for undermining or disrespecting the club, or losing their focus.

**What has changed/will change?**

Nothing yet. Without an even vaguely acceptable bid yet we will be keeping players who are patently unhappy at the club. Solskjaer has taken a page from the SAF playbook and tried to deflect attention and blame back toward the media, but with the players themselves having literally been quoted angling for moves, this is a pretty transparent damage-control exercise.

If an acceptable bid comes in for Pogba and/or Lukaku, we should sell and reinvest.

##Conclusion/TL;DR

We have thus far done very little to solve any of our real problems, and I'm very disappointed that Woodward is still in charge of transfers, and that we've still done virtually nothing to address our squad weaknesses.

There is less than a month left till the start of the 2019/20 season. As it stands I have little cause for hope, and foresee another depressing season spent struggling for consistent form and vying for a top-4 finish.

The problems at the club are systemic, and change is needed almost from top to bottom. Realistically, until the board hires an actual experienced Technical Director/DoF, we will continue to see a total lack of direction in the transfer market, and we will continue to see managers fired when the real problems are above their heads.",reddevils

1589,1589,1589,Can someone explain to me why we don‚Äôt have a director of football?,"It seems like we‚Äôve had so many good players come to the club over the past 6 years, they are average relative to their potential, leave, and then do well again at another club. We try to sign players and get rinsed as we don‚Äôt seem to have a long list of alternatives (particularly outside of the PL where there is less money).

What the fuck is going on? Why doesn‚Äôt the club bring someone in with prior experience as a D of F; who has an extensive network of contacts, and in depth knowledge of good players outside the PL. So we have more options.

Basically hammer down a play style and bring in players who suit and will develop. Bring in managers who will tweak rather than rework the style. We have boatloads of cash. We spend. But it goes nowhere. Because there is seemingly no vision at the club. Because we don‚Äôt seem to see alternatives to how we currently operate. 

I started supporting United in 2006 (am a foreign fan). I‚Äôve found at times over the past few years that I‚Äôm forcing myself to watch games as they aren‚Äôt enjoyable as a spectacle. I don‚Äôt even give a shit about trophies at this point. I just want to be excited to tune into a United game as I know I‚Äôm going to enjoy watching it. For one brief and glorious moment Ole brought that back. And then it fell apart as soon as he signed his contract. 

I know there are millions of other supporters internationally. But I honestly can‚Äôt image choosing to pick United over the alternatives anymore as someone just getting into the sport. It‚Äôs saddening to say the least. And it seems that while a director of football won‚Äôt instantly sort that, it can‚Äôt do anything other than be a positive for the club. So why are no steps seemingly being taken to fill the position? It seems like lip service rather than a sincere desire for change. 

Does anyone actually know, or is it really as simple as that it would erode Woodward‚Äôs power so the best we‚Äôll get is a yes man?",reddevils

&gt; 100,000 fans expected for Man Utd's two games in Perth, against Perth Glory and Leeds United. 'The whole town is being painted red'. Not literally of course.

**6:12 AM BST:** Now to Ole!

OGS: ‚ÄúWe know last year was disappointing. Also know what to aim for this year. Have to close the gap. Have trophies to fight for. That‚Äôs what MU is about - bouncing back after a difficult season.‚Äù

[Please refer to this thread regarding our new rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/cb0p88/meta_in_the_know_announcement_thread/).

We are banning any ""ITK"" posts. It has been difficult to truly verify the validity of these types of users and led to abusive behavior and even doxxing in some cases.

We are more than happy to have people discussing transfer news and rumors, but there will be no more referencing unknown sources at the club. Moving forward, anyone who believes they have inside info a la bloodgate is welcome to send in a modmail. However such posts/comments made without prior mod approval will be removed

It has been mentioned, but the toxicity and abuse towards the sub, within the sub, and towards other subs has been too high. We as moderators have our share of blame in this, but we want to stress that this kind of behavior is not acceptable and we are taking these measures primarily to avoid these things. We want /r/reddevils to be a place where anyone and everyone is welcome to discuss and enjoy the best club on earth without fear of abuse or ridicule.

Which leads us to 2 other small reminders. The report button is your friend, we are way more likely to find and remove and/or ban rule breaking comments if you report them. The downvote button is not a ""I disagree or don't like your statement button"", better discussion is generally had by using the upvote button more liberally and avoiding the downvote one whenever possible.

‚Ä¢ He joined us from Juventus for ¬£18m in Summer 2017 (so expect a signing of at LEAST ¬£18)

Now that everyone's had a bit to calm down and the mod team had time to discuss, we want to address what happened yesterday and talk about the state of the sub moving forward.

**Firstly**: we can again confirm that [/u/spoofex](https://www.reddit.com/u/spoofex/) has deleted his account and stepped down from the moderation team as a result of abuse he received. Whether you agreed or disagreed with his posting methods, I hope we can all agree that abuse is over the line. We do want to be clear though, this is not about Spoofex in particular. Multiple users have face unwarranted abuse and we believe that a line needs to be drawn on the situation.

As a side note, we are not currently looking for more moderators to replace his spot. We will address mod numbers at a later time

**Secondly**: We are discontinuing the Muppet Thread. Having multiple transfer threads has led to unfortunate divisions within the sub. We will therefore be condensing all transfer talk into one thread, the transfer thread, pursuant to the transfer thread rules currently in place. If you would like to discuss other United related events or have less serious discussion, please use the Daily Discussion thread.

**Thirdly**: We are banning any ""ITK"" posts. It has been difficult to truly verify the validity of these types of users and led to abusive behavior and even doxxing in some cases.

We are more than happy to have people discussing transfer news and rumors, but there will be no more referencing unknown sources at the club. Moving forward, anyone who believes they have inside info a la bloodgate is welcome to send in a modmail. However such posts/comments made without prior mod approval will be removed

**Fourthly**: It has been mentioned, but the toxicity and abuse towards the sub, within the sub, and towards other subs has been too high. We as moderators have our share of blame in this, but we want to stress that this kind of behavior is not acceptable and we are taking these measures primarily to avoid these things. We want [/r/reddevils](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/) to be a place where anyone and everyone is welcome to discuss and enjoy the best club on earth without fear of abuse or ridicule.

The downvote button is not a ""I disagree or don't like your statement button"", better discussion is generally had by using the upvote button more liberally and avoiding the downvote one whenever possible.

To add to the above, it is not unlikely that we as a sub will face ridicule from other subs. There's no need to retaliate in kind. If people come to the sub looking to cause problems please report them and move on. If you don't want to face those kinds of comments, we would encourage you to either ignore the comments themselves or stay off of those subs short term.

As a small aside, anyone coming here from Twitter: Please read over the rules and be aware of both those and general posting etiquette.

**Fifthly**: In speaking with the the users running the muppetiers account, we understand that as a result of these planned changes they have made the decision to open the muppetiers sub for muppet-related discussion. For anyone that enjoys muppetry and/or ITK stuff, you are all welcome to participate there (and here, as well), but we have made the decision to focus this sub on more substantial discussion and will be avoiding those subjects as mentioned.

Now, this post will also stand as a discussion point on the above subject or a place for users to ask questions. Please understand that there are some things we cannot or will not discuss but we will be as transparent as possible.",reddevils

1632,1632,1632,Actual Unpopular Opinion: I don't think things are quite that bad,"Let's not forget the way the team started when Ole first took charge. Those players, minus Herrera, are still there. When we were clicking in the first part of the year, we were easily a top 4 side. If we sign Bruno Fernandes, who is better going forward than Herrera, and play Daniel James or Chong on the right, along with AWB at RB, I think we will be alright. Arsenal are shambolic and Chelsea are in a horrible state of affairs as well. After a summer and pre season of building up fitness and Ole trying to play the right football, I think we will comfortably make top 4. I feel my position would be strengthened if we signed Harry Maguire, but nonetheless, those are my honest opinions. I definitely see how it could go pear shaped halfway through the season, but I do not think this is blind optimism. There is a long way to go to be the best in England/Europe, but I think we can be reasonably hopeful for a top 4 finish and a deep run in the Europa League. Thoughts?

EDIT: I realize the owners are bloodsuckers and Ed Woodward is a power hungry control freak who won't hire a DOF. I know the structure of the club is pathetic. I'm purely talking about the football side of things.",reddevils

Rest of Article for those interested.

*Ander Herrera‚Äôs transfer to PSG was made official last week, with the midfielder joining the French champions as a free agent from Manchester United.*

*His arrival has not been met with a great fanfare from the club‚Äôs local media and there‚Äôs doubt over what his role in the club‚Äôs project will be. The Spaniard will have to impress quickly to convince people he‚Äôs been signed as more than simply an asset to sell on in a future transfer window.*

*Marca today do make a big deal of the transfer, or at least a big deal of their chat with the footballer.*

*One of the questions put to Herrera is why he chose to leave Manchester United despite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanting to keep him at the club. *

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like looking at the past,‚Äù Herrera said. ‚ÄúBut there were differences regarding the project and my importance within it. I was very happy, I have a lot to thank the club for, the fans and also Solskjaer. He did a lot for me to stay, but things didn‚Äôt happen. They arrived late and, by then, I‚Äôd already made the decision to play in Paris.*

*‚ÄúI am very happy to have made that decision because I am enjoying this magnificent city, this beautiful stadium and this club, which has a glamour few can match.‚Äù*

*Judging his time at Old Trafford, he explained: ‚ÄúIt has been fantastic. In five years I have played 189 games and I have been important for all the coaches. It is true that that the MVP (Sir Matt Busby award, 2016/17) makes one feel special and very happy, but I keep every moment that I have lived.‚Äù*

*Marca put it to Herrera that he had ‚Äònumerous offers‚Äô when leaving Manchester United, and asked why he chose PSG: ‚ÄúBecause to leave United, the biggest team in England, you need something like PSG, which is the biggest in France. I could not play in another English club. The PSG is a group in continuous development and which is in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.*

*‚ÄúI visited it as a tourist and I fell in love. Now I have the chance to play for his team, which has a very high ceiling and goals, and which has some of the best players in the world.‚Äù*

*Inevitably, Herrera was also asked about former teammate David de Gea potentially moving to PSG, and he answered: ‚ÄúDavid is my friend and is one of the best in the world, for me top 3, but here there are already two great goalkeepers. There is Areola, and Trapp returns after completing a great stage at Eintracht. You have to respect the people who are already there and expect Trapp and Areola to have a great season.‚Äù**",reddevils

1685,1685,1685,What is Ole's philosphy ?,"Serious thread.

&amp;#x200B;

""The United Way"" is not a philosophy and Fergies imprint cannot be mimicked in any way. Ole arrived and we pressed higher and played more forward passes.

Games went on and our xG and xA began to show that luck was more on our side than an actual style of play. Towards the end of the season, our record was awful and we had reverted back to ""parking the bus"". The only problem is our defensive fragility was completely exposed.

Now this summer, we expected 4-5 players in and 4-5 out. Reality is we probably will sell 1-3 (two of them being Rom and Pogba). We potentially might not sign anyone else and if we do they will most likely be ""young and hungry"".

Our philosophy is all over the place from the players we are interested in (Maguire, Longstaff and Bruno) to the players we have retained. They do not adhere to any style of play and have been proven, shit players. We seemingly are trying to recreate ""a great British core"" which is an awful way to rebuild a dying football club. We need a system and a manager who is tactically aware.

Ole could be that guy but has rarely shown any initiative and instead of attempting to make an impact on the team his stance is always reverting back to the ""its the united way"". He promised that he would be successful and that some players would never play for this club again which has proven to be a lie. Our style hasn't dramatically changed after 5 months with a new coach. Flashback to our previous managers and their imprint was very defined 5-6 months into their tenure.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: At Modle, he did imprint a style of play but there are two very key talking points about his career.

1. The Norwegian league at that time and still is essentially equivalent to our league 1/2. Ole, his players and staff all acknowledged the lack of technical football within the league. Ole was credited for brining technical, fast football to the league. He essentially took basic modern-day football and applied the same philosophies within an old-mentality league. Modle was faster and sharper than other teams as they didn't ""route-one"". Modle have not won any trophies under Ole since 2012/13. 
2. When he joined Cardiff, Ole promised the fans that they would play ""fast, exciting football"" and that they would dramatically reshape the foundation of the club. He instead got them into the relegation zone and signed too many players that did not adhere to any type of style. His singings from Molde were particularly worrisome as they couldn't get into the team nor adapt. When he was fired from Cardiff they were in a far worse position than when Ole came into the club. 

This is not an #OleOut thread but I feel like these points should be discussed more. Molde were the first Norwegian team to play ""modern-day football"" but they were soon caught up by their rivals. Ole still hasn't made any real impact with these players and our constant changing on formations begins to show our lack of a plan. AWB (great) and James (good hopefully) are good signings as a start BUT Ole essentially acknowledged that we needed far more in this summer. Ed is not solely in charge of transfers. The actual transfer system is complicated as there are so many different departments involved. Matt Judge is our chief negotiator and he evidently sucks. The scouting network is involved and the management needs to also have their say on targets. It is true that the once-great Manchester United are now rapidly declining in terms of their pull.",reddevils
1686,1686,1686,Saul Niguez ownership and release clause: Complex nature revealed by Football leaks,"According to [documents recovered by football leaks](https://oload.biz/f/jISDScLe59w/AtleÃÅtico_de_Madrid_%26_Quality_Football_Ireland_Limited_-_Saul_NÃÉiguez.pdf) the following is true:

- Quality Sports investments bought 40% of player's economic rights when he was 16 by making a payment of 1m.

- Saul has a 136m release clause at Atletico right now (from other reports) but only 60% of it would be paid to Atletico while rest 40% would go to QSI (headed by Jorge Mendes and former United executive Peter Kenyon)

- If QSI agrees to transfer and Saul doesn't, Atletico will be forced to pay 40% of 135m, so 54m to QSI and the full ownership of the player would be transferred to Atletico Madrid.

1742,1742,1742,How did you become a Man United Fan? || Origin Story ||,"How and when did you guys fall in love with Manchester United? I am just curious about how people end up associating themselves with a club especially when they are not from Manchester or even England. Was it a player? Was it a particular game? Or was it a kit? 

P.S. The last one is apparently not uncommon. I have a friend who is a massive Everton fan who started off as a toffee after he fell in love with their 2010/11 kit!

My Story:

Being a mid 90s kid, I grew up during the time when Manchester United was consistently at the top of English football. My father was a United fan since the 90s (about the time football broadcasting started in my country). He worked long hours and hence I barely got time to hang out with him during the week. But on weekends, I wanted to spend a lot of time with my dad. So every Saturday/ Sunday evening he would sit down in front of the telly with some snacks and shout at the TV screen every so often when he thought Ronaldo was doing unnecessary stepovers. I was like 7-8 at the time and had no clue what was happening. I just joined him and that's how I got into football. 

I remember not understanding anything but getting excited when Ronaldo and Rooney took on players for fun. I thought of Sir Alex as this old guy who chewed gum all the time and would get hyperactive and angry in short bursts.

Time flew by and without even realizing it I fell in love with the game and the club. But in my early teens, when internet and social media were a new thing, I was super active on a Man United fan Facebook group. I could barely relate to other fans. Yes, I had watched a lot of Man United but had no knowledge about the history and the heritage of the club. I had no access to such stuff apart from Man United specials on ESPN and Star Sports (Local channel that broadcasted the EPL). So, it was from around 2007 that I learned about the club, the rivalries, the legends, etc. I stopped saying Man U, understood the dislike for You Know Who and truly appreciated the work of Sir Alex Ferguson over the previous decade. 

I recently visited Manchester and Old Trafford for the first time and it was surreal. I never knew I could be so emotionally attached to a place I had never visited. It was overwhelming. 

As I sit here looking forward to the day I watch my first game at Old Trafford, my head just ran through the years of memories and it got me thinking of other fans and their origin story (if I can call it that).

Looking forward to hearing your story!",reddevils

All in all he had 3-4 solid games last seasons and why I say solid I mean nothing special. He just didn't make any crucial mistakes. Nothing magical or jaw droping from his performance. Matic is good but we all know how just doesn't have the stamina to be regular starter. Back ups? Pereira, Mata and McTominy?

**********

We specifically are light-handed on moderating in this thread because the idea is so we can have a bit of fun. Folks can post almost anything they want and you can go full muppet about the newest social media post someone has liked.

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

Have fun doing what you're doing, and discuss the anonymous ITKs legitimacy all you want, but targeting individuals, and/or haranguing / harassing members of our subreddit is a no-no.

""Turf wars"" are not cool. We keep two separate threads (Muppet Thread + Transfer Thread) so everyone has somewhere to go and discuss transfers.

We will be cracking down on this kind of stuff as it just creates division within the community. We understand that a lot of it is intended to be harmless joking but it always starts to spiral out of control

1763,1763,1763,De Gea's Legacy,"Hi all,

In light of the news and general expectation that De Gea will most likely be penning a new deal at United, it got me thinking of where he's at now in terms of the legacy he'll leave when he does call it a day at United, whether for a transfer or potentially retirement.

Didn't have enough time to deep-dive thoroughly enough to get all goalkeepers' appearance stats, but anyways, here goes: at 362 appearances, De Gea is closing in on Schmeichel's 398 appearances and Alex Stepney is up there at the top with 539 (7th all-time most appearances for United).

If De Gea averages the 50-odd appearances per season he has in recent years for the reported 4 years we're extending, that could make him our highest-appearing goalkeeper of all time, which would be an amazing achievement for someone who started his tenure off with so much doubt surrounding him (and, in my opinion at least, undeservedly has some surrounding him again).

So, I guess now that I've put these numbers out, my question would be: if De Gea were to achieve that feat, and possibly only get a few more trophies along the way, where would he rank for you among our all-time goalkeepers? I know he might never reach the trophy-laden heights of Schmeichel (15 trophies with United vs DDG's current 7), but just figured I'd see what everyone thinks!",reddevils

1777,1777,1777,Scouting the Current CB Targets,"Someone can probably do this far far better than me (and please expand upon what I have in the comments if you can), but with all the recent buzz about bids for CBs, may be beneficial to break them down.

I am ranking these by the likelihood of them happening:

**Harry Maguire (Leicester City):**

Age: 26

Size: 6'4 (193 cm), 220¬†lbs (99.8 kg)

Dominant Foot: Right / Plays as LCB for Leicester and NT

WhoScored Season Rating: **7.01**

Stats: 3 Goals / 1 Assist

Discipline: 6 Yellows / 1 Red

**Strengths**: A vocal leader in the defence, size and strength, set piece weapon and great in the air, pushing forward and composure on the ball, excellent passer and can initiate a counter. He won, on average 3.8 aerial duels a match, 4.9 clearances a match, 6.2 long balls a game, and an 85% passing percentage. He is also still years off what should be considered his prime as a defender. With proper coaching he could very well reach world class status. Helps with the Home Grown quota. Currently first choice center back with the National Team, which adds some prestige. Premier League proven. *Maguire looked far better with the appointment of Brendan Rodgers, as he was better suited to a deeper line and the counter attacking system Rodgers employed (credit to u/*[*Dunkaegon*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dunkaegon/)*)*

**Weaknesses**: Athleticism, slower than the current gold-standard for World Class backs (VVD, Ramos, and Koulibaly), needs a strong DM to cover him in situations where he can get beat on the counter due to lack of awareness and poor positioning, and can be a reckless defender in 1:1 situations. As we do not have a strong DM and are not sure how the Shaw and AWB pairing will offer in cover, Maguire's positioning may pose a significant problem if he tries to play further up the pitch, placing himself out of position for the counter, though this will all depend on what kind of line we are going to implement next season.

From LCFC fans:

""Strengths are on the ball he is one of the best in the league, both driving out of defence and passing. He's also good in the air, physically and will definitely be a good leader of any defence. However he is quite slow compared to some top class defenders like VVD and Ramos. He also does not have the best awareness or positioning which leads to the odd mistake. Ndidi does a great job of covering him and considering you lot haven't got that type of ball winner right now it would definitely be a big problem ""

""IMO he's worth the prices that are being quoted. Don't let Leicester's indifference to him being sold make you think we're pulling a fast one on you. Leicester is currently blessed with an abundance of quality in the CB position so if Maguire were to be sold that would open the door for one of our many prospects to take his starting spot. And if he's not then we're still left with an amazing player ourselves who seems to want to stay. It's one of those situations where it's a win-win for the club no matter what. To add to that he's not trying to force his way out like Mahrez did, which demonstrates Maguire's loyalty and ability to be a team leader and not disrupt the dressing room atmosphere. He's basically the opposite of a diva, which I think is the kind of player ManU would appreciate at this moment.""

Quoted price: &gt; ¬£ 70m

**Issa Diop**

Age: 22

Size: 6'4 (194 cm), 202 lbs (92 kg)

Dominant Foot: Right / Plays as RCB for West Ham

WhoScored Season Rating: **6.89**

Stats: 1 goal

Discipline: 4 Yellows/ 0 Reds

**Strengths**: Tall, broad and imposing, Diop is a bully in the back. He plays with a great deal of physicality, and looks like he has the potential to evolve into a world class player like VVD or Koulibaly, as he grows into a more technical, ball-playing CB. He has great covering speed and has shown on numerous occasions his ability to get back into position to cover the right-back or to stop players breaking past him at pace. Premier League proven. Will only grow in terms of technical ability. His discipline has improved immensely. He did not receive a single red in the PL this year, and actually has not been sent off in his previous three seasons in the top flight. Impressive composure in terms of defending and positioning. Also, playing within what might be a true golden generation of French central defenders, Diop may well be inspired and driven to perform at the highest level to attempt to secure his spot during future call ups. *Diop also has been more exposed to attackers running at him a lot more at a club like West Ham than he would if he were playing at a top 6 club. (credit to u/*[*Dunkaegon*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dunkaegon/)*)*

**Weaknesses**: Diop brings the least to the table, out of all of the targets, in terms of technical ability and the ability to play out the back. He is not as composed with the ball at his feet, and can misplace quite a few passes per match. This might not allow him to slot into the side comfortably, but these are abilities that can be improved upon and will grow naturally with time and patience. If Koulibaly is truly out of reach (and I think he is), then Diop can be the young signing that can grow into a player of that value.

Quoted price: &gt; ¬£ 50m

**Ruben Dias**

Age: 22

Size: 6'1 (186 cm), 170¬†lbs (77 kg)

Dominant Foot: Right / Plays as RCB for Benfica and LCB for NT

WhoScored Season Rating: **6.96**

Stats: 3 Goals / 1 Assist

Discipline: 10 Yellows/ 0 Reds

**Strengths:** Quite young and mature beyond his age, Dias has already established himself in the NT set up and has proven to be a stabilizing force for SLB. Despite his leaner stature, he averaged a hefty 3.2 aerial duels won, per match, 3.4 clearances, and average 1.4 tackles a game. His positioning is superb. Like are other targets, he is comfortable playing out the back. 86% passing rate and 4.4 long balls a game, would make him a perfect fit as we look to field a more attacking side, brisk on the counter in the upcoming season. At 22, he still has the ability to grow and bulk up, which could make him an even more imposing defender. He also impressed against us in the Champions League. That has to count for something.

**Weaknesses**: Aggressiveness. He earned 10 yellow cards in league play this past season. The Premier League is a tougher, more challenging league, and he will have to temper down or could very well follow the path of the CBs we are trying to replace (Bailly, Rojo, Jones). He is still a tad unproven. The Portuguese League isn't quite the same quality as the PL or Serie A. His performances for the National Team instill confidence, but there could still be a significant learning curve for him to overcome. If we want an immediate fix on our back-line, Dias may not be the immediate fix. But he surely has the potential to link up with a fellow Benfica alumni and lead our back-line for years to come.

**Quoted price**: Release clause reported to be between **‚Ç¨50-60m**, but with Benfica attempting to increase it to ‚Ç¨80m to maximize value. Every indication that they will not settle for any less than the release clause, especially after Madrid met Felix's valuation early this summer.

**Kalidou Koulibaly (Napoli)**

Age: 28

Size: 6'2 (186 cm), 220¬†lbs (90 kg)

Dominant Foot: Right / Plays both LCB and RCB, but primarily LCB for Napoli and NT

WhoScored Season Rating: **7.06**

Stats: 2 Goals / 2 Assist

Discipline: 10 Yellows / 1 Red

**Strengths:** Koulibaly is a physical freak.He is also rapid. He can cover ground with the best of them when caught out of position. This is where he is a considerable upgrade over Maguire, and puts him on the level of VVD or Ramos. He is comfortable on the ball, and can initiate attacks going forward. In terms of passing, he averaged 4.5 long balls a game, and an impressive 89% passing rate. He is still only 28 years old, and is entering his prime as a defender. He has also been a stalwart for Napoli. I do not think he has missed a single match for them (please correct if this is wrong). That is something that will make United fans salivate, but I am going to address this in the weaknesses as well.

**Weaknesses**: At 6‚Äô2 he is slightly less of an aerial threat than Maguire, having averaged 2.2 aerial duels won a game and averaged 3.9 clearances a game, but at his height, he is still an impact player in that regard. Koulibaly's positioning is not perfect, and instead of using his pace to get in front of players, he can lean on the rash tackle from time to time, and this leads to a commitment of fouls. A friend of mine who religiously watches Serie A, said he was quite lucky to walk away from some challenges with only a yellow to show for.  Like I said above, he is an absolute stalwart and has rarely missed any time for Napoli. This is great to hear. But also, the pessimist in me tends to think that an injury crisis could be on the horizon. That kind of stability does not last for ever, and especially not for someone who relies heavily on their athleticism.

*Note: Koulibaly suffered a drop in form after he started getting targeted by racist behavior and chants towards the second half of this past season. This is something that is far less likely to happen in England. (credit to u/*[*Dunkaegon*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dunkaegon/)*)*

Quoted price: &gt; ¬£ 120m (release clause of ‚Ç¨150m) Honestly, this is not going to happen. Napoli are pushing for the title this year. They are making massive investments in the squad and just brought in a top CB to pair with him. He is their most integral player. Yes the 50m or so difference between Maguire and him seems like not that much when Koulibaly is arguably a top 3 CB in the world. But Napoli don't want to sell. Unless we want to obliterate the transfer record for a CB and our own transfer record, I do not see him joining this week. But won't completely rule it out.

PLAYERS WE ARE NOT *CURRENTLY CONNECTED* WITH BUT ARE ROUTINELY DISCUSSED AS OPTIONS:

Toby Alderweireld

Milan ≈†kriniar

We have been connected with these players within the past season, but there has been no rumblings from reputable journos to date in regards to these players.

1794,1794,1794,International Duty and the Upcoming Season,"One thing I haven't seen commented on much is how few United players are participating in the various international tournaments this summer. Currently, the African Cup of Nations, the Copa America and the Gold Cup are ongoing, as well as the Euro U21 Championships, and these are the players from the top 6 Premier League sides.


- Man City (7): Mahrez (Algeria), Gabriel Jesus, Fernandinho, Ederson (all Brazil), Aguero, Otamendi (both Argentina), Foden (England U21)

- Liverpool (5): Salah (Egypt), Mane (Senegal), Firmino, Alisson (both Brazil), Keita (Guinea)

- Spurs (4): Aurier (Ivory Coast), Wanyama (Kenya), Foyth (Argentina), Sanchez (Colombia)

- Chelsea (4): Willian (Brazil), Pulisic (USA), Abraham, Mount (both England U21)

- Arsenal (4): El Neny (Egypt), Iwobi (Nigeria), Torreira (Uruguay), Guendouzi (France U21)

- Man Utd (2): Alexis Sanchez (Chile), Wan-Bissaka (England U21)

I only included U21 players who stand a chance of being a part of the first team next season. 

The fact that there are so few United players in these tournaments is mainly a reflection of the majority of the squad being from Europe. Romero and Bailly probably would have been involved had they not been injured. And Fred just wasn't called up. 

But there is a positive to this as well. After last year's World Cup, there was a lot of talk about how the players were tired starting the season. So hopefully this means that United's players will be more rested and carrying fewer injuries than their rivals. 

Especially for teams with countries who go the distance in the AFCON which doesn't end until July 19th. That is only 3 weeks before the opening fixtures for the Premier League. For example, it's not impossible that Salah and Mane won't return to training until after the season has started. 

Meanwhile, the only United player to get significant game time is Alexis Sanchez and he is probably the one player we needed to play a lot and play well as it will hopefully boost his confidence, or at the very least, put him in the shop window given how well he has done in the Copa America. 

Obviously this is all digging for small crumbs of comfort and trying to find any ways to close the gap from last season. But you never know, one or more of the teams above United may struggle as a result of this.",reddevils

1819,1819,1819,State of the Sub - July 2019,"Hi all,

We haven't done this in two years so there are quite a few things to go through here. So strap in! We intend to do these annually from now on.

***
Let's just start with a few announcements. Things that have been implemented since the last update, to provide a brief recap of what has happened in the subreddit.

***

**""Monday Meme-aways""**

Over the years we've had quite a firm stance on the no meme's rules on the subreddit. However, we relaxed on our position mid last year to accommodate subscribers who want memes by setting up the designated ""Meme Monday"" threads for memes. Our main rule still applies and standalone meme posts will be removed but feel free to use the designated ""Meme threads"" and the comments section as you please.

***

**A Muppets World**

We've also introduced the ""Transfer Muppets Threads"" for all the transfer water-cooler gossip and in-the-know (ITK) tittle-tattle. Do take note that information shared in these threads are not to be taken as gospel. We had to have a separate avenue for information coming from unverifiable, unattributable sources and as such anything shared in them threads are to be taken with a fistful of salt. 

It is also to be noted that these threads have led to a useful community led initiative that is the ""Muppetiers Programme"". /u/jroades267 and /u/ubergorp have taken it upon them to collate and post information anonymously from people claiming to have ITK information. They've been doing so independently, without any affiliation with the moderators of /r/reddevils. Despite the growing pains and challenges they face, we'd like to commend community led efforts that aim to contribute to the subreddit..

***

**/r/reddevils Community Awards**

/r/reddevils is also officially apart of reddit's community awards! Community Awards are awards unique to our community, and subscribers can give them to each other as a substitute for reddit's silver/gold/platinum awards. [These are the awards currently available but we're certainly looking to add more over time.](https://i.imgur.com/twSk0kq.png) A small portion of coins from Community Award purchases will be deposited into the /r/reddevils‚Äôs coin balance and these coins will be used to reward members for their contribution when it comes to our official /r/reddevils Awards!

***

**A Sticky Summer**

For those of you who still like to read the sub, but not so fussed about the Transfer related talk, /u/zSolaris has laid out plans for our Summer of daily discussion threads, where we've got themed daily discussion thread for people to chime-in on. These discussion threads have been scheduled for the entire transfer window and we'd like to get your opinions on anything you'd like to see included in these threads.

***

**Rules, Regulations No More Tribulations**

The Rules for this subreddit have been updated and we've included a few new rules to make /r/reddevils a better place for everyone. We've added the following rules that might be worth having a look at:

* **Rule #10: Press Conference Quotes.** Press conference quoted are to kept to one thread to stop the rat race to spam the sub with multiple quotes from multiple twitter accounts. However, on occasion, we allow one or two posts from out top tiered journalists if it's been a slow day and it better helps to facilitate discussion.

* **Rule #12: No editorializing of post titles.** If you're going to make a submission (news stories, tweets, instagram posts, etc.), please do not editorialize title. Leave the original title or use the content of the social media post, whenever possible, as the discussion about the submission will be largely based of your editorialized title rather than the actual content of the submission. Minor edits to make a title clearer are encouraged (i.e., changing ""best player"" to ""[Juan Mata] best player"" to avoid ""click-baitey"" titles.

* **Rule #13: Banned Sources/Content or Illegal Streams.** We keep a running list of banned sources in the [Transfer Tier Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/wiki/transfer-reliability-guide) as Tier 5, these are sources that are known to be poor in content and will not be allowed in the subreddit. We also ban content that may attract unwanted attention from reddit administrators, specifically illegal streams. While we understand trying to watch our team can be hard, all non-legal streams and requests will be removed. Reddit admins have been on a mission to eradicate any community carrying illegal content and we don't want to give them any reason to take a look at us.

***On a side note, please do take note that posts that need to be removed are easily spotted by our moderators but comments that need action might slip through our fingers in bigger threads. We're going to need your help to highlight these comments using the report button.***

***

**Subreddit Census**

A /r/reddevils census was finally conducted after a 7 year gap and it might be an interesting read for anyone wanting to see the dynamics of our user group. We intend to do this annually moving forward. [Link to /r/reddevils census](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/c0wv4h/summer_series_2019_rreddevils_census_results/) 

***

**Mod Matters**

Our moderation team has also expanded over the last year. We've welcomed two new additions in /u/sauce_murica and /u/crebtheberc to ensure that our subreddit is being moderated at all times throughout the day. For those who were unaware, /u/spoofex took a brief sabbatical after years of moderating this place and rejoined the mod team recently. We did a recent AMA as part of our summer series, do let us know if you'd like for it to be an annual thing. It provided a place where you could ask questions related to how our subreddit was run and we felt that it helped clear some doubts on how we moderate this place.

Our subreddit has also expanded quite a bit over the last few years. To put things into context, we had 60,629 subscribers the time we did a ""State of the Sub"" post in 2017 and the number has increased to 167,415 subscribers in just two years. As things stand, we're currently the second biggest footy club sub on reddit just behind /r/liverpoolfc who have a 2000 subscriber lead on us.

So we had to select a ""block"" and we were able to buy 1 ticket each. Our tickets are in the same section but the rows are different ( BB and DD). I sent an email to ticketing office and they said they only have single seats available as of now and asked me to check again closer to the match. Is there a way to get seats together for the match or do we have to figure out other ways like requesting other fan/fans to exchange on match day?

1829,1829,1829,A bot for Going for Gold competition,"#A bot for Going For Gold

Hello fellow reddevils. 

/u/Pedantic_Pat has been running this competition wonderfully and I thought I could help him out by making things easier for him. I saw a post two weeks ago from /u/Pedantic_Pat about wanting someone to make a new bot to calculate points for next season of Going for Gold. So, I made one and added more features to it to make it self-managed.


###Here are some of the stuff the bot can do:

* Submit a new post for a match's prediction
* When the match begins, it collects the users' predictions and store it
* Calculates points based on the match's result automatically
* Posts the points table in the next match's post (I am still working on this)
* Supports EPL, UEFA competitions for now. (I am using a football website's API to get match details. They don't provide details for FA and League Cup sadly)  
* Keeps track of points for individual match types(EPL, Europa,etc) as well as the overall score.  


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

###Game information: &amp;nbsp;

* The scoring mechanism remains the same as /u/Pedantic_Pat's. 
* The structure for a prediction remains the same as  /u/Pedantic_Pat's as well. The only difference is that the user will be making a new comment and will not be replying under /u/Pedantic_Pat's scoreline comment.



How do the league points work?

Correct Result (Win, Draw, Loss): +2 points

Correct Scoreline: +3 points

Each correct goal+scorer: +1 point

Best prediction of game (winner of gold): +5 points

If you lost out on gold due to tiebreaker, you get +3 points


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

####More information about this:  

I will be posting the threads using this account. I am also planning to make the bot's code open source soon, so that anyone else willing to contribute can do so. There are still some things I wish to do with this bot - like, replying back a user's points when someone asks for it (something like the goal-bot), and add more match types in the future(FA cup, League cup).

I reached out to /u/Pedantic_Pat about this but didn't talk to other mods yet. So, I thought of making this thread to discuss about this. I hope I made something useful!",reddevils

Pro :
1. Ball playing ability and good passing range
2. Rarely doing stupid mistake unlike bailly, jones, rojo, smalling
3. Not injury prone like bailly, jones, rojo (he play 2400 minutes for villa last season)
4. He is quick for CB, if we play high line he is reliable to recover from counter.


Cons
1. Defense ability still unproven in EPL, even though I think he is good enough especially on the ground 
2. Might be bullied against strong targetman 


Tl:dr he is similar to lindelof and partner them means we will be very comfortable with the ball and play from the back, but if we play against hoofball team who use giroud/deeney as their targetman even tho if we go against them we can sub smalling for axel.

Of course I still hope we sign a quality CB but if other club wants to rinse us I think Tuanzebe is our best bet.

Read what you may of these stats. 

A few things I'm thinking of doing but my fingers hurt now

1. Because of their longevity, they've played in the pl as youngsters and the natural lack of consistency at that age would lower their stats. I can take similar periods of their careers even though they were perhaps in different leagues.

2. Compare at similar ages that pogba has been with us since he returned.

3. Try to get an overall picture by taking into account other factors like tackling, shooting accuracy, dribbles, etc.

1888,1888,1888,Transcript of AWB's First Interview with MUTV (Inside),"AARON WAN-BISSAKA: HIS FIRST INTERVIEW AT UNITED



The England Under-21 international has¬†completed his move from Crystal Palace, becoming Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's second signing of the summer transfer window following¬†the arrival of Wales winger Daniel James from Swansea City¬†earlier this month.¬†
Aaron will wear the no.29 shirt for the Reds - the same number he wore at his former club Palace.¬†
We sat down with the 21-year-old full-back at the Aon Training Complex for an exclusive first interview, in which he describes his feelings about moving to Old Trafford, discusses his development to date, explains his experience of playing against United and gives a message to the supporters.
Aaron, the deal is done! How does it feel to sign for Manchester United?
‚ÄúYeah I am excited to have finally signed for this team. Every kid wants to play for a team like this. I am grateful and it is an honour to represent this club. I think I will improve every step and learn different things around new team-mates. I think Man United is a big club, a big family, a big fan base, and I think they all stick together and are so tight together.‚Äù

A lot of people are very proud of your achievements in your young career so far and particularly your family. How happy are you that they can be part of this today?
‚ÄúYeah I am really happy. I can see that I have made them proud with this decision and where I have come from, how the journey started, and that makes me kick on and carry on. We stick together and we make decisions on everything. I personally think they know what is right for me and that is the decision I will make. It‚Äôs a good moment, especially for where we have come from, you know this tough journey up until now. It‚Äôs a good feeling.‚Äù

How did you transition from being a winger to one of the most highly-rated full-backs in England?
‚ÄúI think it started with a formation really, you know with wing-backs, and I was playing on the wing back then but we had to play with wing-backs so that is how I got used to it and got the feel of it. From that I enjoyed it and that is how it really all got started.‚Äù

When you were growing up, what sort of things were you trying to develop in your game and were there any players in particular you looked up to? You started out as a winger, right?
‚ÄúI started out as a striker. Growing up, I used to look at Thierry Henry and I just really wanted to do stuff that he did in the Premier League. That encouraged me to push on and try to make things happen.‚Äù

One of our former players Wilf Zaha has spoken about how hard it was to train against you. What was it like training against him and did you learn stuff about your own game?
‚ÄúYeah that is when I realised my actual strengths, from playing against him. It was not easy and it was always a challenge, but at the same time it helped me and made me realise what it is to play against players like him in the Premier League.‚Äù

Your one-on-one defending is unbelievable and you have got that nickname ‚ÄòSpider‚Äô. Tell us about that‚Ä¶ 
‚Äú'The Spider' is about the range and length of my legs when I'm lunging to tackle the ball. That's where the nickname comes from.‚Äù


What would you say are your best attributes as a player?
‚ÄúI would say dribbling, speed and tackling.‚Äù

You have played against United before so what was it like to play against Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and everybody else?
‚ÄúUnited [at Selhurst Park] was my second game in the Premier League and the game wasn‚Äôt going to be easy for me, I knew that. So with me I had to just concentrate and at the same time it was good to play against these players. These are superstars. I learned a lot from that game, playing against them, which has helped me in my development.‚Äù

Have you spoken to Ole and what did he say to you about Manchester United?

Share it here and here alone. The transfer daily threads will now be for Journalists only.

Note: this is the wild west. We aren't policing a thing here, believe who you believe at your own risk. Reddit and subreddit rules about general behaviour do apply though.

**********

We specifically are light-handed on moderating in this thread because the idea is so we can have a bit of fun. Folks can post almost anything they want and you can go full muppet about the newest social media post someone has liked.

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

Have fun doing what you're doing, and discuss the anonymous ITKs legitimacy all you want, but targeting individuals, and/or haranguing / harassing members of our subreddit is a no-no.

********

""Turf wars"" are not cool. We keep two separate threads (Muppet Thread + Transfer Thread) so everyone has somewhere to go and discuss transfers.

We do **NOT** want to see division within our community about ""look at the nerds in the nerd thread"" or ""look at the idiots in the dummy thread"".

We will be cracking down on this kind of stuff as it just creates division within the community. We understand that a lot of it is intended to be harmless joking but it always starts to spiral out of control

1920,1920,1920,Those who aren't Anti Glazer... Why? [Serious],"Morning / Afternoon / Evening all...

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a few discussions this past week or so on this sub, with several people supporting the Glazers and falling for main stream media was one phrase that was thrown at me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm personally anti-glazer. I don't think they're horrid people, I just think they're bad for the club, they came in and took loans against the club to finance a deal for us which left us with ¬£750m of debt and interests that compound with that.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore to that, they're more concerned of commercial deals and income to line their own pockets than keep United at the top (where I believe we belong). However in retaliation to this I often get people point out large sums paid for certain players, ie Pogba and now AWB. To which I think this is where people forget we have revenue numbers of close to \~¬£600m annually, I believe the money we spend on transfers in relation to revenue is closer to the bottom of the premier league table rather than the top. (Will search for source). On top of this, I think all transfers are made with sales in mind, or of high priority rather than purely footballing terms.

&amp;#x200B;

They also pay themselves in dividends of silly amounts for in my opinion doing next to nothing for the club.

&amp;#x200B;

But the reason I ask here as I have, I'm not in a blind rage about the Glazers, I have the figures on it I've researched myself and see very little positive footballing wise, (Commercially they've signed a genius in woodward and that shouldn't be forgotten.) But that for me is it, but if there are things I'm missing that people believe mean they're better than most of us give credit for, I genuinely would like to know.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit - Just wanted to make this absolutely clear, I don't want any of this to turn into some crappy slag match.

Edit 2 - Congrats everyone, lots of different opinions and no name calling.",reddevils
1921,1921,1921,Preventing a couple of good players from leaving the club.,"Some people would be of the opinion as to allow the players to leave if they want to without considering factors such as the importance they've played in preventing the club from a total breakdown. The players in question are of course De Gea , Pogba and Lukaku. 

De Gea wants to leave because he has lost the belief that we want to compete to be one of the best in the world as we were before and also because of the pay disparities between him and Sanchez (please correct me if I'm wrong). He wants his salary to be in terms of what Sanchez receives and the reason behind this is that he's been the best player of the club for quite some time. Agreeing to his wage demands may seem unreasonable but I think the club does need to find a way or another to make him stay. The obvious reason being his World class performances otherwise which we would have been placed much lower on the table.
His boots will be extremely difficult to fill in a short time and personally it would be too much for me to take if both Herrera and De Gea left the club in the same window. Also not to mention that he has been a complete professional handling other stuffs (like his failed transfer to Real Madrid). He stay put and gave his best each time we stepped on the field.

As for Pogba we know that he's a World class talent and our former Academy player as well. He may want to make a move to Juventus or Real Madrid stating different reasons but one of the reasons could be that he too doesn't believe in the club given its current state. I was led to consider this opinion since he said that he wanted a 'new challenge' which doesn't make a lot of sense. And also the fact that he had more contribution that all the other players in all aspects of the game. Also he's very unlikely to leave because he's far too expensive for the suitors. So I guess his opinion could change in a season if we can produce some good football next season and qualify for the Champions league. After all he is one of our own(referring to the academy again)

As for Lukaku I don't have a lot of inputs. I admire the player, but the statement disrespecting our manager was just to much. And I guess his replacement will be easier to find that the other two who could be potentially replaced by maybe a new signing. Also I expect Rashford to improve which he will and Lukaku's transfer would also allow Greenwood more time on the pitch. I see it as a win - win situation.",reddevils

1938,1938,1938,Crystal Palace to Manchester United: the rise of ¬£50m full back Aaron Wan-Bissaka,"Warning: A somewhat long read.

Full text follows:

\-----------------------

When charting the dizzying ascent of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, there really is only one place to begin. The day that altered a young Crystal Palace winger‚Äôs career path is well chronicled but worth recounting given how transformational it has proved.

A Thursday morning first-team training session in late 2016 and Kevin Keen, the then first-team coach, calls for a few under-23 players to make up the numbers. With the under-23 right back injured, Wan-Bissaka gets the call. Not only is the 18-year-old asked to play out of position, but he is set with the unenviable task of marking perhaps the Premier League‚Äôs most devastating winger, Wilfried Zaha.

Time and again, Zaha runs at the callow, makeshift right back, to no avail. ‚ÄúI can remember Wilf \[Zaha\] getting really frustrated,‚Äù Keen recalls. ‚ÄúLike you see in a Premier League game when he gets kicked, and he has a moan and gets the hump. He wasn‚Äôt used to a young boy coming over in training and not being able to get by him.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

The following week, Keen asked for Wan-Bissaka again. Andros Townsend, this time, was shackled impressively. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how he does it,‚Äù Zaha said. ‚ÄúYou may go past him, but he always manages to get a last ditch tackle in.‚Äù

Two and a half years and only 42 Premier League appearances later, Wan-Bissaka is on the verge of a ¬£50 million transfer to Manchester United, which will make the 21-year-old the most expensive defender in the club‚Äôs history. Subject to a medical, a five-year deal, which is worth about ¬£80,000 a week to the player, is likely to be wrapped up by the weekend.

‚ÄúIn the time I‚Äôve been in football,‚Äù Richard Shaw, the Palace under-23 manager, says, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen anyone go from learning a new position, to playing his first three games in the Premier League against Tottenham, Manchester United and Chelsea and coming through with flying colours, to playing his first full season, and being worth this amount of money. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to get your head around.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Wan-Bissaka grew up in New Addington, Croydon, a little over five miles from Selhurst Park. Like many of the talented young players who have emerged from south London in recent years, his skills were honed in cage matches with friends, or on Walton Green, the sloping grass park near his house, where he played with his older brother, Kevin, and children from his estate.

Aged six, Wan-Bissaka had joined Junior Elite, the grassroots youth club Kevin also played for. ‚ÄúHe was a centre forward with us,‚Äù Colin Omogbehin, the club‚Äôs founder, says. ‚ÄúHe had a lot of natural talent, he was top scorer every year. But having said that, he was always willing to work hard. And very humble. Quiet. Shy, almost. But he came alive on the football field, and took no prisoners.‚Äù

It was Omogbehin, who was a coach in Palace‚Äôs academy and now works for Fulham, who advised the Eagles to sign Wan-Bissaka, aged eleven. Doubts about his attitude and application surfaced on a number of occasions and at 14 it took an intervention from his father, Ambrose, to remind him of the need to avoid distractions and bad influences.

&amp;#x200B;

On a couple of occasions, Shaw recalls, Wan-Bissaka failed to show, or turned up late, for games or training. ‚ÄúHe had a few issues,‚Äù Shaw says. ‚ÄúThere were times where he was influenced by other guys. He was in a boisterous group. They weren‚Äôt shy, as you can imagine, coming from south London. And they were close friends. He went to school with them all. It was hard work. People said, ‚ÄòMaybe we need to move him on ‚Ä¶‚Äô But we persevered. I knew that one day things would click, and he‚Äôd get it. And by God, he got it.‚Äù

In 2016, Shaun Derry, the former Palace midfielder and then the manager of Cambridge United, piloted a scheme where Palace‚Äôs academy prospects were invited to train with the Sky Bet League Two club to experience the realities of life outside the Premier League, with a view to a possible loan move. Wan-Bissaka and Noor Husin, now at Notts County, were the first to do so.

‚ÄúThe idea was for them to see a League Two facility: the food, the gym, one training kit you have to take home and wash at night,‚Äù Derry, who also coached a 14-year-old Wan-Bissaka in Palace‚Äôs academy, says. ‚ÄúIt was taking them out of the comfort zone of Premier League life. At that moment, Aaron wasn‚Äôt ready to leave London and come to Cambridge, where we were fighting for our lives.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

There were bumps on the road to becoming Europe‚Äôs most resolute defender, too. Shaw recalls the first time Wan-Bissaka played at right back for Palace‚Äôs under-23s. ‚ÄúIt was a 2-2 draw against Charlton \[Athletic\],‚Äù Shaw says. ‚ÄúHe struggled at times, positioning-wise. One of the goals was his fault because the ball got played inside him. But we just kept persevering with him.

‚ÄúWe knew he had those, what we call, ‚ÄòGo-go gadget legs‚Äô. When he had played as a winger he always tracked back and was very good defensively. The big thing for us was his defensive positioning. He‚Äôs got the ability going forward ‚Äî people have not seen the best of him yet.

‚ÄúBut the main thing is ‚Äî and I‚Äôve heard people saying, ‚ÄòI knew Aaron was going to be a player since he was two years old, in nappies‚Äô, I don‚Äôt buy all that ‚Äî Aaron has helped Aaron. Dave \[Reddington, the Palace first-team coach\] and I have helped him along the way. But he embraced it. If we said, ‚ÄòAaron, we‚Äôre going outside \[to do some extra work\] at two o‚Äôclock‚Äô, he said ‚ÄòYeah‚Äô. Didn‚Äôt even question it.

&amp;#x200B;

A month before his debut against Tottenham Hotspur in February 2018, thanks to a first-team injury crisis, Wan-Bissaka had spoken with Roy Hodgson, the Palace manager, about going on loan to a League Two club. Hodgson told Wan-Bissaka he was part of his plans but only 18 months on, he must now plan for life without him.

Shaw insists that Wan-Bissaka is equipped for a career at Old Trafford. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a guy who just gets on with life,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAfter every game I text him to say, ‚ÄòWell done, keep working hard.‚Äô He always says, ‚ÄòYep, I will‚Äô. Whoever he‚Äôs playing for, I‚Äôll say the same. That‚Äôs what got him here.

‚ÄúIf Aaron goes to Manchester United, a World Cup, anywhere, he won‚Äôt change.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll take everything in his stride.‚Äù

Perisic: This saga is one we have discussed often, especially as Inter has come looking for Lukaku. Inter tried to dick us around, we put our foot down and rejected Mou's desire to bring him in. Worked out for us. An older player coming off a solid World Cup, but nothing spectacular, especially at the price. Could have been a very regretful signing for us.

Morata: Even though Lukaku hasn't really panned for us, it is not hard to believe that we made out better than Chelsea in this saga. The red haired devil from Madrid looked certain to sign for us, and would solve our crisis up top. Looking back, it is very doubtful he would have. Playing within a superior Chelsea squad, he couldn't get it done. How would he have fared within this mess?

Leon Bailey: I was super excited about this potential transfer. Thought he was a future world class winger and could have solved our huge hole on the right side. It now looks like I was ***very wrong.*** The press speculated a big money move could be coming from us in the winter of 2017-18 and the summer of 2018, with Arsenal and other clubs looking at him too, as he had a strong 2017-2018 season for Leverkusen, Bailey never elevated his game this season and honestly regressed.",reddevils

1955,1955,1955,"ICYMI: A complete Manchester United-focused summary of tonight's BBC 5 Live Sport transfer show, featuring David Ornstein + Statman Dave","For those who are unaware and perhaps intrigued by some of the quotes that have just started doing the rounds online, from 20:00 - 21:30PM UK time tonight, BBC Radio 5 had their Live Sport Transfer discussion show, and Manchester United were a prominent topic of discussion for the panel, which featured Charlie Adam, BBC's David Ornstein, the Telegraph's Sam Wallace and our very own Statman Dave. I thought I would provide a quick summary of the key points for anyone who missed out and doesn't want to dig through an hour and a half of the transfer thread, so here goes:

----------------------------------


- The initial topic of discussion, as I'm sure you're all aware of by now, is that Aaron Wan-Bissaka is expected to become a Manchester United player imminently, now that we've agreed on a transfer fee valuation of ¬£45 million + ¬£5 million in bonuses with Crystal Palace. Ornstein once again confirmed that AWB flew into Manchester today by private jet (congratulations to the resident muppets of r/reddevils who successfully tracked the right flight). The announcement of a 5-year deal is expected to take place tomorrow following a medical.

- In more interesting news, the next United piece of discussion turned to our search for a new centre-half, with Ornstein and the panel confirming it to be a priority signing this summer. Two key pieces of information relating to this CB search followed:

- The first is Tier 1 confirmation from David Ornstein that Manchester United were not only one of the clubs interested in signing Matthijs De Ligt, but the *only* club to have tabled a ""serious contract offer"" to the Dutchman at the time of his last update from sources. However, Ornstein also followed up by stating that De Ligt rejected this same offer. One thing that hasn't been mentioned in some of partial quotes floating around on the internet is that Ornstein said he expects this situation will change over time, which could mean that we submit a new offer or that rival clubs come through with their own deals. As far as I'm aware, this is the first time a British Tier 1 source has confirmed our interest and bid for De Ligt. (u/seaders has kindly provided me with the actual audio for this section, you can listen here: https://streamable.com/43ko0)

- Another centre-half who is confirmed to be a clear target for us is Leicester's Harry Maguire. Ornstein explained that the Englishman is involved in a straight fight between Manchester City and Manchester United, but crucially also stressed that Leicester are not desperate to sell Maguire, and would only do so if their valuation of ¬£75 million was met. Ornstein implied that both City and United are reluctant to meet this valuation, and neither club has submitted an offer near this amount yet.

- The Telegraph's Sam Wallace says that we are making a move for Lyon's 15-year old wonderkid striker Rayan Cherki. This is presumably another attempt by Nicky Butt to substantially strengthen our academy.

- Statman Dave mentioned that we were one of the clubs interested in Tanguy Ndombele, but that he will be going to Spurs this summer.

- Amidst rumours of Liverpool being interested in our target Bruno Fernandes, David Ornstein crucially mentioned that the Scousers will be having a ""low-key"" summer this year, with no intention to splash big money on names such as Lille's Nicolas Pepe or Lyon's Nabil Fekir. If this information is true, it sounds like we have a free run at Bruno.

- Kalidou Koulibaly is of interest to both Manchester United and City. However, Statman Dave and Ornstein stated that Napoli don't have an intention to sell him this summer. The signing of Manolas does NOT change this, with the two seen as the first-choice centre-back pairing for the Italians this upcoming season.

- Finally, David Ornstein tantalisingly concluded the programme by telling viewers to keep an eye on Sampdoria CB Joachim Andersen, as it is expected that he'll be making a move to the Premier League this summer. Andersen was linked with us last summer, and given our search for a CB it's possible that we'll be in for him again. This update concluded the show.

1990,1990,1990,"An explanation of transfer fees, instalments and player amortisation","Some bloke posted a shit article that didn‚Äôt understand basic accounting and I spent 10 minutes typing this response on mobile. There are far too many articles out there from shite sources that don‚Äôt even understand the concept of an asset.

Hopefully this isn‚Äôt a complete bore but if it is then, well... you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôre not an accountant...

A players fee is almost always paid in instalments but the instalments don‚Äôt really matter from an accounting point of view because all clubs will use accrual accounting. The instalments matter from a cashflow perspective only.

From an accounting point of view, when a club buys a player it‚Äôs basic ledger entries. Let‚Äôs make up an example: we buy Pogba for ¬£90m, tie him to a 5 year contract and the instalments are ¬£40m up front and ¬£25m a year for two more years. When the purchase happens the following occurs:

‚Äò-¬£40m Cash (Upfront instalment)

+¬£90m Asset (Pogba‚Äôs cost to us (accounting principles state an asset should be the lower of cost or net realisable value)

+¬£50m Liability (the remaining instalments we owe)

When the next year rolls around and the next instalment is paid:

‚Äò-¬£25m Cash

-¬£25m Liability

The same occurs for the final ¬£25m instalment.

Those entries deal with all the cashflows and anticipated cashflows.

Now here‚Äôs the part that no article can seem to get right. Amortisation of a players value over the life of their contract...

Pogba is an asset to us and his value is initially at cost. However, he has a contract with us and, if he chooses not to renew, can leave for free at the end of his contract. As a result, we need to follow the principles of accounting that state that we have to amortise his value straight line for each year of his contract to account for this ‚Äúloss of value‚Äù as we move closer to the expiration of his contract.

So on OUR balance sheet, after one year, he will be worth ¬£72m to us (¬£90m / 5 years = ¬£18m reduction in value). Whilst this is a non-cash entry it‚Äôs really quite important as the ¬£18m reduction on our balance sheet affects our bottom line. This is amortisation in a nutshell. It‚Äôs the equivalent of depreciation but for intangible/financial assets.",reddevils
1991,1991,1991,Why this transfer window isn‚Äôt a disaster (yet) and why there is hope for muppets like me. A timeline of transfers.,"Like everyone else on this sub I have slowly let the muppetry over take my very being and as a result I have decided to look for any sign of hope.   

Below I have listed every incoming transfer after SAF retired and the date that each transfer was announced.  

Before we get to the list a couple of notes:  

1) You will notice that Mata, Vald√©s and Sanchez are not included on the list due to the fact they were signed during January transfer windows.  

2) Since Fergie retired we have completed 22 transfers, only 5 of which were announced at this point in the transfer window (25th June).  

3) This data is not completely applicable to this transfer window due to the fact most of the transfers on the list were completed when the English transfer window ended at the end of August instead of the current deadline on the 9th of August.  

Remember it‚Äôs the hope that kills you. Here is the list - 


7th May - Memphis Depay  
7th June - Varela  
7th June - James  
8th June - Bailly  
10th June - Lindelof  
26th June - Herrera

Share it here and here alone. The transfer daily threads will now be for Journalists only.

Note: this is the wild west. We aren't policing a thing here, believe who you believe at your own risk. Reddit and subreddit rules about general behaviour do apply though.

**********

We specifically are light-handed on moderating in this thread because the idea is so we can have a bit of fun. Folks can post almost anything they want and you can go full muppet about the newest social media post someone has liked.

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

Have fun doing what you're doing, and discuss the anonymous ITKs legitimacy all you want, but targeting individuals, and/or haranguing / harassing members of our subreddit is a no-no.

********

""Turf wars"" are not cool. We keep two separate threads (Muppet Thread + Transfer Thread) so everyone has somewhere to go and discuss transfers.

We do **NOT** want to see division within our community about ""look at the nerds in the nerd thread"" or ""look at the idiots in the dummy thread"".

We will be cracking down on this kind of stuff as it just creates division within the community. We understand that a lot of it is intended to be harmless joking but it always starts to spiral out of control

2012,2012,2012,The Glazers,"To preface, I understand that this is going to be heavily down-voted so it doesn't really affect me.  


I'm here to tell you why the Glazer's **aren't** actually bad owners of Manchester United.  


There seems to be a bandwagon, tribal, outrage culture surrounding 'the Glazers' and how we want #Glazersout. In fact, the recent trends indicate that the Glazers must be committing heinous crimes against football/humanity/your life.

  
They aren't.  


Using statista, and an update of the current revenue from Man Utd, it can be noted that Manchester United have generated around ¬£6.5B in revenue in the last 10 years, and since the glazers arrived, around ¬£7B in Revenue.  


There is a graph floating around talking about how the Glazers are siphoning money into their own debt. It labels 'reported net debt' and shows a figure of around ¬£500m - this is not the same sort of debt as say if you went over in overdraft or if you overspent - this is business debt.   


What can be noted, is that Manchester United is the largest business club in football. I.e. There are other teams, most notably Wolves, PSG and Manchester City that have ownership injections of money. This is fundamentally *bad* for the football economy - this is the sort of thing that puts the prices of players from max ¬£80m to 300+ in a short space of time.  


Manchester United is run a little bit differently. They generate their own revenue and feed that back into the club. Now, the consensus seems to be that the Glazers are taking money from the club and not investing much back in; they have invested net ¬£666m (the devil's number) back into the club; this is not gross spend (total spend without sales)

&amp;#x200B;

So, Manchester United is run like a business. The Glazers are running Manchester United like a business...in football this shouldn't be considered a bad thing. There seems to be a glorification of sugar daddies in football, as if it would solve life's problems.  


'Why can't we spend ¬£75m on Maguire and just leave it?'

Well, that is relative to the market yes, this isn't something we were saying even 5 years ago. ¬£75m would have been the third most valuable player ever.  


Sugar Daddies are what is fundamentally *wrong* with football. Just pumping money into the economy, as people know, causes massive inflation. If you make more money, your money is worth less. So, in order for the Glazers to keep up, they have to borrow. This is where the debt is in play. This debt is more like a mortgage. It's there, it's not intrusive and putting money from your business to pay the business debt to retain assent leverage is *not* a bad thing.  


It seems very much that people are scaremongering, bandwagoning to get the Glazer's out because they think they should 'just spend the money' to keep up, in an already fragile market. This is a poor business decision, it would not only affect the club but also the entire football economy. If you have 6 huge spenders every year and it gets more and more and more each passing season, it's going to cause a market crash, where the value of players goes down. Suddenly, the only teams staying afloat are the Sugar daddy teams like PSG, City, Wolves etc - it's a very bad event waiting to happen.  


Yes we want the Glazers to invest, and so far, going all guns blazing and splashing 175m+ on players is a little absurd to just accept as a rightful thing.  


A football club the size of united is not some strange vanity project, it's a functioning business.

We're in London from the 9th until the 19th of August and it just so happens that the opening match against Chelsea at OT is on the 11th! A livelong dream can be fulfilled!

So, what I wanted to ask some of you more experienced lads is how I'm best to go about this?

I've just signed up as a United Member which from my understanding gives me the options to buy tickets right from the club itself once they go on sale - however, I've got 3 mates who are coming so we'll need 4 tickets.

I've also found this website:  [https://www.thomascooksport.com/event/Manchester-United-v-Chelsea/15276](https://www.thomascooksport.com/event/Manchester-United-v-Chelsea/15276) and they seem to do a pretty well priced match ticket + accommodation package for all of us. Is this sort of website worth using or are they a ripoff?

Also, I need to do an OT tour while I'm there, so I'm thinking the Monday morning after the match would be best as we won't get in to Manchester until the Sunday morning after the bucks party in Edinburgh the night before.

Any info you lot can share would be much appreciated :)",reddevils

2052,2052,2052,How Ronaldo played and was before all his extraordinary goal achievements,"For the last few years he became a severe goal scorer and his game play changed as a result, but i came across videos of him when he was still ""that"" player that gave us that excitement that unkown part of his play this is just a personal view which im sure will be shared by millions and it brought back so many memories of genius that we have missed since 2009 imo,i won't really go into his superb goal record as its always talked of but instead the part many forget or simply dont know. Ill try and keep it short but this is Ronaldo so will be difficult. 

Im almost 31 and i remember when we signed him, and straight away we all like so like the knock off Brazilian Ronaldo? Good luck, his first few years he was this show boat player with no end product but brought excitement to us, had briliant skills that often failed, brilliant dribbling, but lacked the final third, didn't realy score alot but we didn't know what was to come, he was very unpredictable but effective as he would cause problems. But all this made all fans jump from seats be it home or at grounds, his step overs, his cut backs, his sprint speed, his first touch was like second nature even at 18 odd he didnt even think about it as he knew it was good compared to say lukaku, his frustrations when he failed was because he knew he, we knew he was capable of so much more, but not once did he collapse and give up he kept trying and trying till he done right, but still made us happy watching him play because it was fun, all the cheers from crowds of a simple flick, run, step over, cut back, back heel etc. One of his first call ups to Portugal he lost ball in opposition box but ran all way back to win ball but concedes penalty showed his hunger and desire to win, game vs millwall fa cup final which he scored in but he played well with tricks and flicks where Dennis wise fouls him, wise spits on his own hand and puts on Ronaldos face! Did Ronaldo moan? Yes, did he give up? Hell no. 

For me the turning point was rooney vs Ronaldo and the red card, following season he changed, he had bulked up alot, mentality changed and its like he went up levels, his dribbling was effective, started making passes, became stronger, more aware, the boos from other fans actually made him better, then he became the main man, before he went missing in key games, but at 23 or so he turned up, we were in a way being run by a guy at 23 /24 who we knew could do something to step up and outshine anyone.

2006/07 season till 09 imo he was unplayable, no one came near him, he became the go to guy for utd, this is where the goals started coming in, he became effective, match winning, so many memories, the run and goal vs fulham, pompey free-kick, arsenal free-kick/rooney Ronaldo counter, pompey long range, so many key games where he didnt even score. 

07/08 we win title and champions league, he was this monster who coudnt be stopped, goals went up severely at 42, scored 2 goals a game for 3 games running, and this wasn't even his peak, he was the best in the world here, messi wasnt compared to him then, utd fans were mesmerized by this talent by now Brazilian Ronaldo wasnt compared to him either, we relied on him hugely here, that briliant goal vs porto, the header vs Roma, granted we had such a good team then but still Ronaldo stood out. 

Moves to real madrid where we all know what happend, but the years before this was imo his fun years that brought us so much joy to fans that we haven't had since he left, i feel as a fan i watched him from this kid who had talent but needed that guidance and for me, fergie was so crucial to his development, that maybe just maybe he woudnt of been this Ronaldo without fergie? From a kid at 18 to 34 we all been there we all watched him transform to a beast of a player who seems to me takes everything serious when it comes to being the best possible, he worked to become the best and to be one of 2 best for over 10 yrs is something i won't see in my lifetime i also believe messi and Ronaldo needed eachother to push otherwise there is no one else to keep them on their toes. 
 
Two reasons i wanted to write this 1 the old vidoes, 2 my nephew's always say Ronaldo the goal scorer and any skills moves are associated with neymar etc many younger fans wont remember or know the Ronaldo before his goals but that's the Ronaldo i always remember, the joy, excitement and so on for me, he worked to be the best and broke so many records along the way that im glad i seen him all the way, i assume retirement is on cards soon? But in 20 years or more ill talk of him and say i remember it all, i was there he was the best player i seen, the consistency is unheard of from say 21 till now he turns up most players peaked for few years he got better and better and im certain won't see another like him while im still alive, he also turned up for his national team where in game vs Sweden for the play off for world cup he got an applaud from zlatan which says it all, or vs Spain in world cup, how many times have we said it about him thats why for me the greatest player i ever seen. 

I have few videos which ill share, no music just pure commentary to remember it all. As long as least 1 fan remembers just like me it will be worth it. Iv kept it short as possible otherwise this would turn into a book.

2054,2054,2054,Should Angel Gomez get a loan after Mata's contract extension?,"I don't get to watch much of the academy but I understand that Gomez is a player of the same qualities that Mata, not only from the physical aspect but also in the technical qualities and playmaking/creation as a number 10 player.

Angel didn't get a lot of times the past 2 seasons and seen Juan would be with us for at least 2 more years maybe is the right time for him to get a loan and start having more playing time under his belt and when the times come to play regularly he isn't just an academy prospect.

I don't think that a bottom table club would suit him, since most play very defensive, and probably a dominant team in the Championship would be better for his development

What are your thoughts on this?

EDIT: I don't think that in the end Ole is gonna rotate the team that much between all 4 competitions and that the youngsters won't going to play in one or two of those tournaments as starters. If we don't sell players and bring 3 to 4 (rumored) more then the first team squad is going to have a lot of players in quantity

Having said that we did have a purple patch during the start of Ole's reign and were clearly the best team in the premier league for about 10-12 games.

So even if we cannot replace all the holes during this window we can expect a few players to step up (Mctominay showed great potential, hopefully Fred settles down and the youngsters will always be hungry to perform). A long shot but maybe even Axel could try to cement his centre back spot.

If this does work out the team could easily qualify for the Champions league even if they don't perform well at the transfer market.",reddevils

- Cannot maintain high intensity play for long periods
- Deteriorates physically in second half 

Comments:
It would seem from the first two games that Sanchez has struggled to find himself in positions out wide, he has shown a complete unwillingness to engage with athletic defenders on the dribble opting to retain possession instead. Sanchez is also struggling to take the ball in tight spaces and performs much better when he has 5 yards to settle on the ball. Has performed much better when receiving the ball in the center areas of the pitch where he has quickly tried to engage his striker with a through ball or link up play. Sanchez has also looked good as a secondary option in the box when receiving crosses and has favoured a late run off of the fullback.",reddevils

What a cracking game of football! 6 goals in the last 15 minutes. Both teams were showing promising plays but lacked the last bit of cutting edge. 

England defense was shocking in the last 15 minutes or so as Kenny conceded a PK, Tomori missed clearing and Deano pulling out a Karius.

So as you can see, United can sign a player from nothing. It all happens pretty quickly, and it can all go silent for a few days such as Matic. So please do not fret. Our Tier 1s rarely break news, it's usually other team's/country's

Heard something from your butcher?

Dave from Marketing got loose lips after his second WKD blue?

Did Karen tell you some juicy gossip?

Share it here and here alone. The transfer daily threads will now be for Journalists only.

Note: this is the wild west. We aren't policing a thing here, believe who you believe at your own risk. Reddit and subreddit rules about general behaviour do apply though.

**********

We specifically are light-handed on moderating in this thread because the idea is so we can have a bit of fun. Folks can post almost anything they want and you can go full muppet about the newest social media post someone has liked.

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

Have fun doing what you're doing, and discuss the anonymous ITKs legitimacy all you want, but targeting individuals, and/or haranguing / harassing members of our subreddit is a no-no.

********

""Turf wars"" are not cool. We keep two separate threads (Muppet Thread + Transfer Thread) so everyone has somewhere to go and discuss transfers.

We do **NOT** want to see division within our community about ""look at the nerds in the nerd thread"" or ""look at the idiots in the dummy thread"".

We will be cracking down on this kind of stuff as it just creates division within the community. We understand that a lot of it is intended to be harmless joking but it always starts to spiral out of control",reddevils

2175,2175,2175,Back The Policy,"Not a lot of positivity surrounding Man Utd at the moment so I wanted to raise a point on our season ahead and transfer targets which I‚Äôm happy to see.

Now obviously it‚Äôs gutting being in the Europa League but what it does mean is 10+ Guaranteed games vs relatively easy European opposition. It also sets the expectation lower on those European nights and actually takes more pressure off of achieving top 4 through the league as you can qualify by winning it.

It provides a great basis if used correctly to bed in the young talent currently at Man Utd. It also finally gives us a chance to take a risk on signing 18-23 year olds with potential high upsides. 

Daniel James is a great illustration of that, I don‚Äôt expect much from him in the league this season but this year the Europa league should set him up perfectly to be a first team player next year. I also see the same opportunity for Dalot to get some regularity playing in that RB position. If AWB signs then we have another young player who will get similar exposure to what he had at Palace and not PSG/Juve/Barca, which will be great for his development.

I would like to see us chase after a few more of these players, people like; Gon√ßalo Guedes, Ismaila Sarr, Donny Van de Beek, Declan Rice &amp;amp; Leon Bailey. 

It is kind of key to chase these players now as if we do qualify for CL next year the opportunity will be missed to bed these players in with much more ease.

The opportunity this year is also perfect for McTominay, Chong, Gomes, Greenwood, TFM, Tuanzebe &amp; Pereira as these guys will have games that they can feature in and games where the coaching staff can risk playing them.

Finally it is slightly controversial but I would not mind taking a view this year on the Carabao &amp;amp; FA cup and really use it this season as a platform for growing the youth as well. If we do that along side the Europa I could see us giving the likes of TFM &amp;amp; Chong 10-15 appearances this year.

We specifically are light-handed on moderating in this thread because the idea is so we can have a bit of fun. Folks can post almost anything they want and you can go full muppet about the newest social media post someone has liked.

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

Have fun doing what you're doing, and discuss the anonymous ITKs legitimacy all you want, but targeting individuals, and/or haranguing / harassing members of our subreddit is a no-no.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm almost sure that someone else might done have a comparison like this with greater accuracy and/or more detail.

* The seasons compared are the last Ronaldo one, the last SAF one, and everything since then. The last season was not separated into Mourinho/Ole eras.
* I only included aspects which are directly comparable, with the notable exception being transfers in/out. As these often included youth or reserve players.
* I wanted to include injuries per season, and total days lost. But there wasn't any reliable source for a full breakdown.
* I did not include the top assister, as I really did not want to count goals individually for every season.
* Stats do not tell the whole story, but I found it interesting to look at what is there.
* You'll notice that I didn't highlight certain cells, because the story isn't as clear cut. For example, our record in the 08/09 CL campaign was 6-6-1 on the way to a Final. In the 18/19 season, it was 4-1-5 which ended in a Quarter-Final. I could have segregated the matches into group stages and knock-outs, but I simplified it. For now, at least.
* Speaking of CL, any season where we did not participate was labeled the worst. Arrogant? Perhaps. But I have high standards for our team.
* Compiling this took a bit of effort. I assume that there is a whole stat pack available if you cough up the cash. The sources used were the Premier League's official site, WhoScored, and Wikipedia. One or two of these may be prone to errors, but I wasn't looking for an exact science and I am not getting paid for this.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the comparison is far from perfect (I did do stats in my previous job). If the Reddit community likes it, I can proceed to do all the other seasons including our time as Newton Heath. These would probably be in separate tabs by decade. And a special tab comparing teams from different eras. Assuming something like that doesn't already exist.

2224,2224,2224,Time to hold our hierarchy and club of our status to a higher standard,"I posted this comment earlier but think as a club and community we need to take a more mature look into not only the pogba situation, but the state of our Club as a whole. The only reason David de gea is still at this club is because of a broken fax machine. Ronaldo began engineering his move to real three years before his left. Rooney threatened to go to city. If you want to keep the best players in the world the ambition of the club has to match and it hasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs football, it happens. Swallow the pride,  act like a big club and hold onto him, build a successful future and a lot of things can change in a year. Selling every player who flirts with a move is weak and we have too much deadwood to be focusing on selling one of our only world class talents. Can‚Äôt expect to have world class players want to stay and waste their prime years if the club doesn‚Äôt respect itself enough to invest in a future and structure that is required to be a big club. Real have one down season after here champions leagues and drop 300 mill before July  because they mean business while we can‚Äôt figure out what structure we want as a club. Build it and they will come, and as a club we have built nothing worth coming to. We need to question our hierarchy not the only player we had that made team of the year.
 
This is also the short sided mindset that resulted in us selling players like Memphis and Zaha due to ‚Äúmentality‚Äù only to see them succeed in clubs with an established culture and philosophy. At some point people need to realize it‚Äôs not them; maybe it‚Äôs the club. Too many good players under perform in our badge for us not to question the environment at the club. Juventus, Madrid, Barca, bayern, and all the clubs of our magnitude don‚Äôt struggle with this issue and there‚Äôs a reason for that.

But you know what makes it not fun? When one ITK/someone who's interested in ITKs starts taking swipes at another.

It's not fun, nor smart, nor helpful to anyone. In fact, it's the complete opposite of fun as you're spoiling it. Continuously doing so starts to amount to you bullying another member of this subreddit. *And* that will lead you down the path toward removed comments and a potentially a ban.

It's definitely not fun. Not for you, not for me, not for any of the mod team.

If you have problems with a user, either on the sub or through private messages, hit us up with a mod mail and we'll look into it.

2244,2244,2244,Discussion: The pace of our transfers,"I see a lot of frustration on this sub (and wider fanbase) regarding how slow our transfer dealings seem to be moving. Full disclosure I actually started writing a reply to a comment in the daily transfer thread, but word-splurged over many topics. So instead of this being buried I'd like to see other reds views on this, in the spirit of reasoned discussions on this sub vs mindless sniping at one another. 

**Other Club's Transfer Success**

Fans are looking at clubs like Real Madrid and Dortmund and asking how they're able to complete their business so efficiently, whereas we are taking forever. People often mention the ""United Tax"" as a hold-up but IMO we have a different ""United tax"" now because we don't have the same pulling power as RM. They're basically guaranteed a CL finish every year regardless of instability and are consistently competing for silverware. It was no secret Hazard wanted to sign for them for ages, and that makes the transfer a lot simpler. RM/Barca have always had the allure as long as I remember and that hasn't changed. Small side point - they've had 6 garbage transfer windows according to their fans, and this summer spree was LONG on the cards. To the point where reporters have said other clubs are waiting for the chain reaction in transfers from Real conducting their business, because signings like Hazard were nailed on for ages.

For United, it's a different situation. Back at the height of our powers under SAF, aside from being hamstrung by the Glazers, SAF was able to get in the players he wanted, without having to try and ""sell a project"" to potential targets. Now, there's massive instability and players (read: wages) need convincing of coming here, over any other top club - and we've seen that clearly with the decimation of our wage structure since SAF left. 

**Player Power**

This also leads to player power and the clusterfuck that is dealing with high powered agents and modern negotiation tactics. Look at players like MLD and Greizz who are able to tease bullshit in the media for months and drag out their decision making - even Barca are falling trap this, so it's definitely a reality for us. Was it Anders or Mata we signed through some hidden broker type people who negotiated on our behalf to get the deal done? From what I've read something similar is happening with Bruno Fernandes. According to reports, other players we're linked with like Rabiot and Tielemans are shopping around for clubs too - they have many offers on the table and we're just one of the pack - again slowing down negotiations.  

**Broadcasting Money**

Then there's the amount of money in the game. With how lucrative TV deals have gotten, quality players are the commodity for clubs, not cash. This is why we see teams like Palace holding out for 50m+ for AWB because what motivation do they have to sell? They know they have one of the most talented players in the league in that position and it's their right to make the transfer as workable for them as possible. Just like it is for us with the potential sale of Pogba/Lukaku etc (i.e. we should absolutely be holding out for top money for them, otherwise fuck off, they stay).

I understand teams like Dortmund have gotten signings across the line quickly - but ask yourself are they players that suit the level Dortmund are looking for (ability, price etc) - and that's why they were able to get them? Or were they going after the best players in the European leagues like we are? They have stability, a defined transfer strategy and a relatively consistent level of club. I'm not so sure it's comparable; I don't think we can be compared to either Dortmund or RM. Look across at the transfer business of the PL top 6 - who else has made so many signings, let alone major ones? Besides Pool and City, everyone else needs a lot of work just like we do.  

**Media**

Last point on this ramble is the media. Times have changed with every single tiny development in a transfer being blown up and spread across the world in seconds, without any thought to the complexity of negotiations, especially in a tough market situation as now (see points above). There's so many reasons for transfers to be slowed, so many factors impacting decisions that making quick deals for the players we REALLY are no longer quick deals. 

Should we just pay what clubs are asking? I get that view and agree somewhat - especially when it kills me how the pigfucker Glazers are siphoning money out of our United, when we should/could use those interest payments to meet asking prices and get deals done. Conversely, where does it end? Today we pay the ¬£75m asking price for AWB because that's what we desperately need now, but how will that impact our next signing, and the one after, and the one after that? Clubs know we'll just pay the asking price, so lets up that United tax some more! No matter what state the business is in, is that sustainable long term? As armchair fans and keyboard warriors it's easy to say so. EDIT: Not to mention the media pressure of ""¬£50mil down the drain"", for every player we overpay for that doesn't perform.

Having said all that, I'm feeling just as impatient and wish we could get these fucking transfers over the line yesterday, because the insane pace of media updates vs the actual reality of real life make these things feel like they've dragged on FOREVER already. Could Ed/Judge etc do better? Fuck yeah, but I don't think that's the only factor at play. Am I chatting shit? Probably. It's easy to overlook points to fit your narrative so please change my mind! Fingers crossed, OGS gets what he needs, to at least have a good crack next season. And then, is given TIME and CONSISTENT BACKING with the proper vision and philosophy, just like Klopp/Pep.

**TLDR Top talent is scarce and money is everywhere. We're not as appealing as we were in the past, and negotiations with rich clubs, agents and players are ever more complex. Our transfer policy/long term strategy is still unresolved and the glazers are parasites.**",reddevils
2245,2245,2245,"An analysis on the 4-4-2 diamond, our transfer dealings and next season.","Looking at our summer activity, I think we can assume that Ole will be looking to adopt a system that is very similar to the one Liverpool played this past season: a 4-4-2 diamond. Although Liverpool's system looks like a 4-3-3 on paper, Firmino drops so deep that it actually functions as a 4-4-2 diamond, with Salah and Mane playing as split strikers who become wingers without the ball. Their system has a few characteristics: high intensity, a high line of engagement, a high line of defense and a very hard working midfield that cover a lot of ground.

Of course, I am not recommending we copy their system like-for-like; we are stronger in some areas and weaker in many others. Our system should be similar in philosophy but different in approach. Below I will list a few key aspects that we must focus on when comparing ourselves to Liverpool.

**1) Strikers must be comfortable out wide**

The real strikers in Liverpool‚Äôs formation are Salah and mane. They are both comfortable out wide and making runs in behind. I think we are somewhat decent in this aspect with martial, Jesse, Rashford, Lukaku and maybe **James**. They must also press well and work hard off the ball

**Resolution**: Martial and Lukaku have to improve on their movement and their work rate The attackers as a whole need a better end product. Jesse and Rashford are basically perfect to play this system and it will play to their strengths. Hopefully, we bring in Sancho but it is not the end of the world if we don't (should we play this system).

**2) Attacking fullbacks, and Trent Alexander Arnold.**

We all know how good Roberson and TAA are in attack. Both have good energy and crossing ability. In comparison, young has been fucking shite going forward and Shaw has been average. We will really need to improve in this aspect and signing AWB is a good start. I don‚Äôt buy AWB‚Äôs supposedly weakness in attack because every fullback will look shite going forward in that palace team. 

I would like to highlight TAA‚Äôs contribution to this Liverpool team. He has a fantastic cross, probably one of the best in the entire league. But what is less talked about is his ability to playmaker. He has the vision and passing ability to basically become a playmaker from the fullback position. It also means he is good both out wide and slightly tucked in towards the middle. He is basically Pep‚Äôs wet dream and is a huge reason why Liverpool can afford to play the midfield they play and still not look toothless. TAA actually missed three matches during that period where they dropped points: Leicester, west ham and Everton. And also the 3-0 defeat at the Camp Nou.

**Resolution**: Shaw and **AWB** need to provide high energy, providing a threat in the final third. Shaw had a decent season but looked really toothless going forward, this needs to be addressed this season. AWB is a former winger and hopefully will get the license to push forward. Dalot will be fantastic in this role against smaller teams.

Of course, we don't expect TAA's level of playmaking from our fullbacks, we have creativity in midfield that they don't: Paul Pogba.


**3) Pressing and the defensive trident**

If you watched the UCL final, Klopp actually completely neutralised Spurs' buildup play with a very different kind of pressing game we have seen from them in the past. They gave Lloris, Alderweireld, and Vertonghen all the time in the world with the ball and pressed their out ball instead. Mane and Salah were constantly on their fullbacks, Firmino in between the defence and midfield lines, Henderson, Gini and Fabinho on the midfield three of Sissoko, Winks, and Eriksen. This resulted in the entire Spurs team being extremely disconnected. Winks, Sissoko and Eriksen were never in the game. The center-backs simply were not given the chance to find them in a good position at all and had to resort to hoofing it forward.

But that's where the Liverpool defensive trident (Fabinho, Van Dijk and Matip) came up absolutely huge. All three are very very good at winning 1v1 duels, both on the ground and in the air. Van Dijk and Matip both came out of the defensive line to win a ball if needed. This meant that Kane never had a chance to hold up the ball to bring someone else into play. This meant that there was a large area of the pitch (the midfield and the line between midfield and defence) where Spurs could not even compete. Poch realised this and started getting trippier and rose on the ball. Their best phases of play all came from either Rose running down the left flank or Trippier hoofing the ball in behind the defensive for Kane, Son, and Alli to run onto. The speed and positioning of Van Dijk and Allison coming off his line meant that this was only semi-successful. Matip and Van Dijk both recover extremely well even when they lose duels, and this meant that their defensive shape never suffered.

**Resolution**: Ole has a huge job to do, drilling a structured and high-intensity press. The work ethic of the entire team also comes into question. Will Martial and Lukaku work as hard as Salah and Mane? We are losing one of our hardest workers in Herrera and work rate in midfield has been a problem for a long time. I believe that Pogba is not lazy and is someone who is highly influenced by those around him (watch him play beside Kante for France). Pogba is absolutely crucial to our team and we should not let him go at any price. He is our best player and our most creative player. Our midfield will be extremely important due to how 'limited' our fullbacks are compared to Liverpool. Hence, we need to sign and field players who work hard, have high energy and also the ability to bring the ball forward. 

**Rabiot** works hard and does well in defense. He is also a great ball carrier and has good passing ability. N'dombele and Lo Celso in comparison, are both slightly more suspect in defensive situations.
**Fernandes** has the technical and playmaking ability to take some of the burden off Pogba. He also works hard and presses well - the closest to Firmino we cant get. Play Fred and McTominay in the pivot instead of Matic. Matic is far too slow and has been very poor on the ball. Jesse will also be decent in the Firmino position.

We also need a defender who is comfortable breaking out the defensive line to win a ball then have the positional sense/awareness/speed to recover. We need **De Ligt/Maguire/KK**, I don't think Dias, Diop or Tuanzebe are good enough yet. Bailly and smalling should be kept. Jones and Rojo should both be binned for obvious reasons.

**Conclusion**

All of our rumored signings point to this being the main formation Ole will adopt this season. De Ligt, Rabiot, AWB, James and Fernandes all fit the type of signings we should be looking for and will represent a fantastic season. Of course, pre-season will be extremely important. The 4-4-2 diamond is a somewhat newish system, and preparation will be key. Ole and the coaching team have a huge task in front of them.

We can only hope Ed is ruthless and smart enough to get us the players we need, and not settle for much poorer choices.",reddevils

[Here are the results.](https://imgur.com/a/cfPy4ld)

********************

**Age**

Unsurprisingly, 95.2% of our user base is under the age of 35. What might be somewhat interesting is that 59.5% of the userbase indicated that they were 25 and younger. Here is a [chart showing the break out by age group](https://i.imgur.com/osbAnbv.png) and also an [age distribution graph](https://i.imgur.com/XsG3NgB.png). We do have some older Reds, it is good to see we're not just a rabble of youngsters...just mostly one.

********************

**Gender**

Again, not surprisingly, /r/reddevils is overwhelmingly male. [97.8% of respondents indicated that they were male](https://i.imgur.com/lRwmvSo.png) which translates to [1,799 out of the 1,839 responses](https://i.imgur.com/smsyfZi.png). We do have some ladies here (28) along with some folks who preferred not to say (5) and some folks who marked themselves as Other (7). The others are as follows: three kinds of helicopter (1 Apache attack helicopter, one fighter helicopter, and one regular ol' helicopter), an alpha male (as opposed to a regular male?), a cyborg, a robot unicorn, and a Wookiee. [It appears that our resident Wookie has been here at least since the last census in 2012.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/12dguu/official_2012_rreddevils_census_results/) Good to see you're still around.

********************

**Employment**

[Most of the reds are employed \(71.5% across the Employed, Student Employed, and Self Employed categories\)](https://i.imgur.com/nVE5acT.png). We do have a lot of students here (37.4% across the two student categories) as well. There is one user I am absolutely jealous of though. [One individual](https://i.imgur.com/n7r7aec.png) indicated that they were retired. Enjoy retirement sir/madam. The rest of us have 30-40 years to go it appears.

********************

**Residence**

[The majority of /r/reddevils is UK or US based](https://i.imgur.com/8LYpyrl.png) (29.1% and 28.1%, respectively). Asia (which is overwhelmingly South and Southeast Asia) comes in third place followed closely by the Europe (non-UK). *So much for our American overlords* (don't deport me /u/sauce_murica).

[If we're breaking it down by the regions](https://i.imgur.com/LfqwDpt.png) I arbitrarily put into the census form, UK (England) is the clear winner with 360 members reporting living in England and another 89 specifically saying they are in Manchester. 

********************

**Season Ticketholder/Matches Attended**

Overwhelmingly, [most of us here are not season ticketholders](https://i.imgur.com/I7B1cqg.png) (98%). I did get some feedback that I didn't include an option for ""used to be, have cancelled because we're shit"" so I'll keep that in mind for next time.

[Most folks are unable to attend games](https://i.imgur.com/NS7t2HL.png) as well. We do have some very dedicated individuals who make it out to 31+ games per season. You guys are the real MVP.

******************

**How long have you been following football/Manchester United?**

[We have a lot of folks that are here for the long haul](https://i.imgur.com/olm4LM4.png). Very few have been following either football or Manchester United for 3 or less years. Our recent...bumps in the road...*obviously* did not have a part to play in that.

*****

**How long have you been a subscriber to /r/reddevils and how do you usually access Reddit?**

[We have a lot of new-ish users here](https://i.imgur.com/cKe0Tmk.png), which is expected since we've had two massive growth spurts in the last two years. We've also apparently had some folks who have been on the sub for 20+ years...despite the sub only being 8 years old. Silly of me to let that be an option...

This next bit is probably the most surprising to me. [Based upon the traffic data that Reddit provides](https://i.imgur.com/bkMnpK0.png), I expected a bit more of an even distribution for how folks access the sub. [Based on the census though, it appears that Reddit apps are the most popular by far](https://i.imgur.com/sCr7YF8.png). Now this is just a sample of our userbase so it very may be what the traffic stats are reporting but it appears our more active userbase prefers a Reddit app over anything else. When on desktop though, our active userbase prefers ""Old Reddit"" to ""New Reddit"" by over a factor of 2. Long live Old Reddit.

**Favorite Current Player**

So this is the question most folks vocally said they had problems with...mainly because they couldn't choose since our squad was so shit. [Victor Lindelof is easily the favorite amongst voters though](https://i.imgur.com/zZ4vtmj.png), having amassed right around a quarter of the votes. The much slated Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford come comfortably in second and third, respectively. 

Shout out to the 111 other McTerminator lovers out there!

**Favorite All Time Player**

[During the previous census](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/12dguu/official_2012_rreddevils_census_results/), Eric Cantona won the vote with Scholes and Giggsy coming second and third. [In this years edition, Wayne Rooney was the undisputed king of /r/reddevils](https://i.imgur.com/qNUEHjW.png). He is followed by Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Scholes. Eric Cantona dropped to sixth place behind fifth placed Giggsy.

I was really happy to see Park get some love, he came in tenth (tied with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer). To my fellow Koreans/Park lovers out there, it's good to know I'm not alone!

2250,2250,2250,Motivation in sport - a bit of psychology,"Hey all!  


There was [a post on motivation](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/bx2qqo/opinion_team_understanding_is_the_best_motivator/) 10 days ago, courtesy of u/ManUnited02 and I have commented that if you guys want, I can write up a small explanation on the psychology of motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

My background - I have been a competitive judoka for 10 years or so, and have just finished my Psychology Bsc. I have written a 10 page long paper (literature summary) on the motivation in sport, so I'm trying to make a short summary of that here.

&amp;#x200B;

So, motivation is fucking complicated. For starters, **there are at least 32 theories, on how it works** (Ford, 1992). It comes from the latin word ""movere"" which unsurprisingly means ""to move"". And frankly, it is goddamn hard to define. But, all in all, it is the complex of everything that effects behavior - what causes is, what makes it stick, what controls it (Gy√∂mb√©r and Kov√°cs, 2012).

There are a lot of notable motivation theories from a lot of different people, but I'm not going to go into details about them. Sorry,  Freud, Maslow, Bandura and Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi.

To be more specific, I won't really explain any theories in detail. I want this post to be short and easy to comprehend. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, motivation has a lot of factors, people are motivated by a lot of different things. **The main thing is, that there is not one thing that is a better motivator.** While Ryan and Deci argues that when you do stuff for the sake of doing it and do it for yourself (intrinsic motivation), not for the money, the trophies or other extrinsic factors - it is a higher level of motivation, there is no major evidence to suggest that it actually makes you do better. **In fact, even if you do it for the sake of doing it, other extrinsic factors (how much you earn, what the coach thinks, what your family thinks) still effect you.** 

Also, while you will see a lot of comments around the internet, that someone is a mercenary and only does such and such for money, no-one will admit that they only are in it for the money. There is **only one player, who have publicly stated that he did it for the money and nothing else** \- Benoit Assou-Ekotto (former Spurs player) - *""I play football to earn a living and make my life easier.‚Äù‚Ä¶""Yes, I play for the money but then doesn‚Äôt everybody who gets up in the morning and goes to work? They do it to provide for their family.""* (Goaldotcom, 2011).

He was in the PL, while a whole lot of other players, who do it for the sport and are motivated intrinsically, weren't, so as you can see, as long as you are motivated, it doesn't necessarily matter, how you are motivated (although this is only anecdotal evidence, but let's not dwell on it). But, in theory, as you become more and more internally motivated, you are a lot less dependent on other factors (Williams, 2010). So, if you love doing what you do, you will get less demotivated by earning less or winning less trophies.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, as you see, the important factor is that you - as a player - find something that motivates you. And that depends on your personality. Which is again determined by genetics, socialization and a multitude of other factors.**

&amp;#x200B;

**One other factor that is really important, is how much you believe in yourself, that you can achieve the goals you set.** Your self-belief, or self-efficacy determines what kind of goals you will set and if you actually believe that you can and will do them or not. If you don't believe in your skills or in yourself, you are more prone to giving up and not pursuing your goals.

&amp;#x200B;

**How can the coach help?**

While a lot depends on the players, a lot depends on the coach too. There are a lot of stuff the coach can do - but again - I'm trying to be short. The best coaches in general are positive,  communicative, give constructive feedback, make players feel better about themselves and set achievable goals. Threatening players, making them feel negative about themselves and giving negative feedback is generally not something you want in a coach.

There are exceptions though. Sometimes a good-old hair-dryer treatment is what turns the table and some players need really rigid coaches (approaches) to flourish. It all depends on the players' personality.

So - in summary, **the best coaches realize how to motivate each and every player and then do it accordingly. They are harsh and rigid with those, who need that kind of treatment, and are positive and flexible with others.**

One other factor that can benefit the coaches is if they know motivation-theories so they can use them.

&amp;#x200B;

**And a final TL;DR - Motivation depends on a hella lot of stuff, and the best thing a player do is to find out what motivates them and keeps them motivated - and then use it to be motivated. One way isn't necessarily better, than the other. Same with coaches.**",reddevils
2251,2251,2251,I want to attend a home game (14th or 26th December) and have a couple of questions that I can‚Äôt find answers to in the sidebar. (Will remove after I get answers),"1. Do I have to purchase a club membership first to be able to attend the game? 
2. I understand the Everton game will probably be sold out very soon and the Boxing Day Newcastle game is very sought after too, but is there still a chance to get tickets if I order the membership today? 
3. If I‚Äôm living in London for the 19/20 season and of course not a ST holder, so is there any chance I can make it to a Cup game or a game like Watford away or is it not possible? 
4. Will we have any Europa league games between 13th December and Early Jan that I should look to attend because tickets are more easily available? 

I want to create a budget for my Manchester trip so any help would be fantastic! 
Thanks guys!",reddevils
2252,2252,2252,Should I get he Membership Pass just to get official tickets to 1 game?,"I‚Äôm planning to go to Manchester during the winter break, and it looks like I the only Home game I can watch during my trip is the game against Newcastle. 

I have learned that the only way I can get official tickets from the club is to get a membership pass first. However I want to know more opinions on this. Should I do it or is there any cheaper/better alternatives like getting the tickets through some websites? I really want to get the front row seats which if I remember costs around ¬£40-50 in the website. Will I be able to get tickets around that price by buying it elsewhere? 

Also, I am currently studying in the Netherlands and I heard that there is a possibility to apply for away European games if I have the membership pass. Is this true? If so I can take this into account before actually getting a membership pass",reddevils

2254,2254,2254,Quick question about the Liverpool game and how ballots work,"I've got a ""milestone"" birthday coming up the weekend that United are scheduled to play Liverpool and I'd love to make it over to see it. I've been to a few United games before but never one that works via ballot. Could you help me with these questions?

1) When is the EXACT fixture date and time likely to be confirmed? Any time Saturday will be fine, as would be Sunday early afternoon. Any time past that will not be possible unfortunately due to flights, and it is not possible for me to get the next day off work.

2) When does the ballot open?

3) Is the ballot to buy tickets, or to have the opportunity to buy tickets? (See Q No. 1 for why this is important!)

4) In the event you miss out on the ballot, what are your alternative options for getting a seat?

5) Obviously I hope there will be more than me going. I know everyone who wants a seat needs an official membership but how does this work in terms of the ballot? Do you all enter your memberships together or are they all entered separately, meaning some of your group get through and others don't?

Thanks!",reddevils

2337,2337,2337,Less than a month until opening day. What have United done to fix last seasons problems?,"##Intro
Apologies for the wall of text. Skip to the conclusion for the TL;DR.

If you watched any of last season you'd likely agree it was (with the exception of the few weeks of Solskjaer's honeymoon period) a disaster. It's difficult to imagine quite where and how it could have been worse. By contrast it's fairly simple to identify some reasons *why* it was so bad. Quite a few of these apply to the entire post-SAF period, but I'll be focusing on last season and this.

I've listed a few basic problems, many of which tie into one another. I'll then go over what has been (and is being) done to rectify them*:

1. Toxic Manager.
2. Incompetent planning/player recruitment strategy.
3. Not enough quality at centre-back.
4. No right-sided width.

##1\. Toxic Manager
Mourinho was obviously a poisonous presence at the club toward the end of his tenure, and IMO he made his position untenable and had to go.

One particular memory I'll always have of his reign is of the West Ham away game in late September. Mourinho started with Scott McTominay in central defence. This was, in my view, a fairly blatant act of petulant, vindictive defiance, given that we had Bailly and Darmian on the bench that day. It was a big, childish middle-finger in Ed Woodward's direction. We quickly went behind in the game, and lost 3-1 having been out-competed (something we'd see time and again last season) to the extent that we made Mark Noble look like prime Edgar Davids.

It's clear, though, that Mourinho was never *really* the main problem.

**What has changed/will change?**

We obviously sacked him and brought in Solskjaer, who had a great honeymoon period. However, after a few weeks the hopeful promise of better times ahead was replaced by the realisation that nothing of significance had changed. Ole seemed to fairly quickly abandon his initial positive style of play for a more pragmatic ""Mourinho"" approach, as he began to graso the strengths, weaknesses, and fitness levels (more on that later) of the team he had inherited. We finished the season in pretty abysmal form.

##2\. Incompetent planning/player recruitment strategy
This of course ties into problem 1, because much of the reason for Mourinho's toxicity was born of a lack of respect and backing shown to him by the board, and in particular Ed Woodward who, it's plain to see, is not fit to run the sporting side of the club. Give Mourinho a contract extension, then a few months later refuse to sign his targets? Is it really a surprise he offered up the spiteful team selections and depressing press conferences that he did?

**What has changed/will change?**

Well...nothing so far, and there seems to be little hope anything will be changing on this front this summer. We did hear rumours that the club was looking to appoint an experienced sporting director, but those rumours soon became whispers that ex-players such as Rio Ferdinand and Darren Fletcher were being considered for the job, then faded away entirely. We continue with Woodward making the signings.

The signing of Daniel James (ANOTHER LW!) when we are crying out for a RW is fairly typical of our recent transfer strategy, although in a vacuum it looks like a good value signing. Hopefully it's suggestive of plans to move along some of our high-paid under-performing LWs in the near future.

##3\. Not enough quality at centre-back
Mourinho identified centre-back as a problem. To be fair, anyone watching us could identify centre-back as a problem. He previously brought in Bailly and Lindelof (though how much input he had in those signings is debatable). He discarded Bailly after he showed himself to be a very raw and risky player, and he showed almost as much distrust in Lindelof after his shaky start at United. Lindelof has settled in much better, and looks a decent signing but we need more and better in this area. Mourinho wanted Alderweireld, but the board clearly said no. Toby would have been an expensive, short-sighted, Matic-like signing, but would surely have made us better.

**What has changed/will change?**

Nothing so far this summer (get used to reading that), with not even a solid rumour of anything in this area. This has to be a priority this month, right?

##4\. No right-sided width
It's fine to favour one side of the pitch when you attack, but we have no reliable threat on the right, and haven't had for some number of seasons now. We mainly used Lingard and Mata there, and neither offer actual width on that side, as they look to drift inside with or without the ball. This makes us very predictable, and thus easier to defend against.

**What has changed/will change?**

Again, nothing really. Maybe the AWB signing (more later) allows us to use Dalot as a right winger? I'm not convinced we'll see any better results from the right side this season, and we've heard basically no rumours of any signings in this area.

##5\. Aging first team right-backs
Young started last year quite poorly at RB, but still seemed to fade, and put in some frankly embarrassing performances toward the end of the season. Valencia and Darmian were basically non-factors. Dalot was bought last year, but is a raw prospect rather than the finished article.

**What has changed/will change?**

Well, we allowed Valencia to leave. And then splashed out on AWB. This is a good signing with the potential to be a great one, though I'm not sure it solves our immediate lack of right sided attacking width, as he looks far more accomplished in defence than attack. But at least we signed someone for the first team, FINALLY.

##6\. Aging defensive-midfielders
Mourinho's signing of Matic was an ok, if typically short-sighted one**. Matic followed his good first season with his worst Premier League campaign (not helped by injury). He's functional, but shouldn't be more than a squad player at a club of United's stature, and seems to be on the decline. Herrera has had two good seasons in five years at United (2014/15 and 2016/17).

^** ^It's ^odd ^that ^Ed ^allowed ^this ^signing ^but ^not ^Alderweireld...

**What has changed/will change?**

Nothing helpful so far. We failed to offer Herrera the sort of contract he was holding out for, and he's off to Ligue 1. IMO he's not worth the money he's getting from PSG and, although this will be a blow to the dressing room, it shouldn't be a blow on the pitch provided we sign any decent defensively minded midfielder. Matic is on the books for next season with an option for a further year (which I suggest we don't take).

We needed younger reinforcements here before Herrera's departure. We certainly do now he's gone. Mario Lemina would be a solid if unspectacular replacement for Herrera, but we're going to need a replacement for Matic as well.

##7\. General lack of work-rate and fitness
We were the third laziest team in the Premier League last year behind only West Ham and Cardiff. The clubs we should be seriously competing with are all in the top 9 for distance covered. This is totally unacceptable. Mourinho complained about last year's pre-season preparations being disrupted by the world cup, but other teams had this same problem and dealt with it better, so as the head coach he surely has to take some blame for himself.

**What has changed/will change?**

That remains to be seen. United must simply must work harder next year and must prepare correctly over the next month. This is the one problem I have real hope and expectation will be sorted out.

##8\. Wage-structure and ongoing contract negotiations
We really, really shit the bed when we signed Sanchez. Not only has he been awful since joining, but his bloated contract has torn-up any semblance of a wage-structure and unsettled several players. Guys like De Gea are rightfully thinking that if Sanchez is worth 350k p/w, why aren't they?

**What has changed/will change?**

Well...Rashford just got 5-years 200k p/w. That's a lot for a 21 year-old who has much to prove. For reference, that's the same money De Gea's currently on. He is very valuable to the club as a home-grown player, and hopefully he builds on last year and makes that contract look like a bargain.

We're gonna have to decide what to do with De Gea. His uncertainty over his future must surely have played a role in him having probably his worst full Premier League season. I'd pay him, as he's a World-Class keeper who's likely not yet entered his prime.

Ultimately to settle things down we need to get rid of Sanchez, though that will likely necessitate paying him to play elsewhere.


##9\. Problem players
I'm mainly referring to Pogba and Lukaku here, but you could include others like Martial who's hearts don't appear to be in it.

If we learnt anything from the SAF years it has to be that no player is bigger than the club. You need to identify players who do not want to be here, and you need to have the resolve to get rid of them.

Beckham, Stam, van Nistelrooy, Keane, etc etc. Lots of great players were shown the door for undermining or disrespecting the club, or losing their focus.

**What has changed/will change?**

Nothing yet. Without an even vaguely acceptable bid yet we will be keeping players who are patently unhappy at the club. Solskjaer has taken a page from the SAF playbook and tried to deflect attention and blame back toward the media, but with the players themselves having literally been quoted angling for moves, this is a pretty transparent damage-control exercise.

If an acceptable bid comes in for Pogba and/or Lukaku, we should sell and reinvest.

##Conclusion/TL;DR

We have thus far done very little to solve any of our real problems, and I'm very disappointed that Woodward is still in charge of transfers, and that we've still done virtually nothing to address our squad weaknesses.

There is less than a month left till the start of the 2019/20 season. As it stands I have little cause for hope, and foresee another depressing season spent struggling for consistent form and vying for a top-4 finish.

The problems at the club are systemic, and change is needed almost from top to bottom. Realistically, until the board hires an actual experienced Technical Director/DoF, we will continue to see a total lack of direction in the transfer market, and we will continue to see managers fired when the real problems are above their heads.",reddevils

We try to sign players and get rinsed as we don‚Äôt seem to have a long list of alternatives (particularly outside of the PL where there is less money).

What the fuck is going on? Why doesn‚Äôt the club bring someone in with prior experience as a D of F; who has an extensive network of contacts, and in depth knowledge of good players outside the PL. So we have more options.

Basically hammer down a play style and bring in players who suit and will develop. Bring in managers who will tweak rather than rework the style. We have boatloads of cash. We spend. But it goes nowhere. Because there is seemingly no vision at the club. Because we don‚Äôt seem to see alternatives to how we currently operate. 

I started supporting United in 2006 (am a foreign fan). I‚Äôve found at times over the past few years that I‚Äôm forcing myself to watch games as they aren‚Äôt enjoyable as a spectacle. I don‚Äôt even give a shit about trophies at this point. I just want to be excited to tune into a United game as I know I‚Äôm going to enjoy watching it. For one brief and glorious moment Ole brought that back. And then it fell apart as soon as he signed his contract. 

I know there are millions of other supporters internationally. But I honestly can‚Äôt image choosing to pick United over the alternatives anymore as someone just getting into the sport. It‚Äôs saddening to say the least. And it seems that while a director of football won‚Äôt instantly sort that, it can‚Äôt do anything other than be a positive for the club. So why are no steps seemingly being taken to fill the position? It seems like lip service rather than a sincere desire for change. 

Does anyone actually know, or is it really as simple as that it would erode Woodward‚Äôs power so the best we‚Äôll get is a yes man?",reddevils

**Firstly**: we can again confirm that [/u/spoofex](https://www.reddit.com/u/spoofex/) has deleted his account and stepped down from the moderation team as a result of abuse he received. Whether you agreed or disagreed with his posting methods, I hope we can all agree that abuse is over the line. We do want to be clear though, this is not about Spoofex in particular. Multiple users have face unwarranted abuse and we believe that a line needs to be drawn on the situation.

As a side note, we are not currently looking for more moderators to replace his spot. We will address mod numbers at a later time

**Secondly**: We are discontinuing the Muppet Thread. Having multiple transfer threads has led to unfortunate divisions within the sub. We will therefore be condensing all transfer talk into one thread, the transfer thread, pursuant to the transfer thread rules currently in place. If you would like to discuss other United related events or have less serious discussion, please use the Daily Discussion thread.

**Thirdly**: We are banning any ""ITK"" posts. It has been difficult to truly verify the validity of these types of users and led to abusive behavior and even doxxing in some cases.

We are more than happy to have people discussing transfer news and rumors, but there will be no more referencing unknown sources at the club.

To add to the above, it is not unlikely that we as a sub will face ridicule from other subs. There's no need to retaliate in kind. If people come to the sub looking to cause problems please report them and move on. If you don't want to face those kinds of comments, we would encourage you to either ignore the comments themselves or stay off of those subs short term.

2393,2393,2393,Actual Unpopular Opinion: I don't think things are quite that bad,"Let's not forget the way the team started when Ole first took charge. Those players, minus Herrera, are still there. When we were clicking in the first part of the year, we were easily a top 4 side. If we sign Bruno Fernandes, who is better going forward than Herrera, and play Daniel James or Chong on the right, along with AWB at RB, I think we will be alright. Arsenal are shambolic and Chelsea are in a horrible state of affairs as well. After a summer and pre season of building up fitness and Ole trying to play the right football, I think we will comfortably make top 4. I feel my position would be strengthened if we signed Harry Maguire, but nonetheless, those are my honest opinions. I definitely see how it could go pear shaped halfway through the season, but I do not think this is blind optimism. There is a long way to go to be the best in England/Europe, but I think we can be reasonably hopeful for a top 4 finish and a deep run in the Europa League. Thoughts?

EDIT: I realize the owners are bloodsuckers and Ed Woodward is a power hungry control freak who won't hire a DOF. I know the structure of the club is pathetic. I'm purely talking about the football side of things.",reddevils

Rest of Article for those interested.

*Ander Herrera‚Äôs transfer to PSG was made official last week, with the midfielder joining the French champions as a free agent from Manchester United.*

*His arrival has not been met with a great fanfare from the club‚Äôs local media and there‚Äôs doubt over what his role in the club‚Äôs project will be. The Spaniard will have to impress quickly to convince people he‚Äôs been signed as more than simply an asset to sell on in a future transfer window.*

*Marca today do make a big deal of the transfer, or at least a big deal of their chat with the footballer.*

*One of the questions put to Herrera is why he chose to leave Manchester United despite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanting to keep him at the club. *

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like looking at the past,‚Äù Herrera said. ‚ÄúBut there were differences regarding the project and my importance within it. I was very happy, I have a lot to thank the club for, the fans and also Solskjaer. He did a lot for me to stay, but things didn‚Äôt happen. They arrived late and, by then, I‚Äôd already made the decision to play in Paris.*

*‚ÄúI am very happy to have made that decision because I am enjoying this magnificent city, this beautiful stadium and this club, which has a glamour few can match.‚Äù*

*Judging his time at Old Trafford, he explained: ‚ÄúIt has been fantastic. In five years I have played 189 games and I have been important for all the coaches. It is true that that the MVP (Sir Matt Busby award, 2016/17) makes one feel special and very happy, but I keep every moment that I have lived.‚Äù*

*Marca put it to Herrera that he had ‚Äònumerous offers‚Äô when leaving Manchester United, and asked why he chose PSG: ‚ÄúBecause to leave United, the biggest team in England, you need something like PSG, which is the biggest in France. I could not play in another English club. The PSG is a group in continuous development and which is in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.*

*‚ÄúI visited it as a tourist and I fell in love. Now I have the chance to play for his team, which has a very high ceiling and goals, and which has some of the best players in the world.‚Äù*

*Inevitably, Herrera was also asked about former teammate David de Gea potentially moving to PSG, and he answered: ‚ÄúDavid is my friend and is one of the best in the world, for me top 3, but here there are already two great goalkeepers. There is Areola, and Trapp returns after completing a great stage at Eintracht. You have to respect the people who are already there and expect Trapp and Areola to have a great season.‚Äù**",reddevils

2446,2446,2446,What is Ole's philosphy ?,"Serious thread.

&amp;#x200B;

""The United Way"" is not a philosophy and Fergies imprint cannot be mimicked in any way. Ole arrived and we pressed higher and played more forward passes.

Games went on and our xG and xA began to show that luck was more on our side than an actual style of play. Towards the end of the season, our record was awful and we had reverted back to ""parking the bus"". The only problem is our defensive fragility was completely exposed.

Now this summer, we expected 4-5 players in and 4-5 out. Reality is we probably will sell 1-3 (two of them being Rom and Pogba). We potentially might not sign anyone else and if we do they will most likely be ""young and hungry"".

Our philosophy is all over the place from the players we are interested in (Maguire, Longstaff and Bruno) to the players we have retained. They do not adhere to any style of play and have been proven, shit players. We seemingly are trying to recreate ""a great British core"" which is an awful way to rebuild a dying football club. We need a system and a manager who is tactically aware.

Ole could be that guy but has rarely shown any initiative and instead of attempting to make an impact on the team his stance is always reverting back to the ""its the united way"". He promised that he would be successful and that some players would never play for this club again which has proven to be a lie. Our style hasn't dramatically changed after 5 months with a new coach. Flashback to our previous managers and their imprint was very defined 5-6 months into their tenure.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: At Modle, he did imprint a style of play but there are two very key talking points about his career.

1. The Norwegian league at that time and still is essentially equivalent to our league 1/2. Ole, his players and staff all acknowledged the lack of technical football within the league. Ole was credited for brining technical, fast football to the league. He essentially took basic modern-day football and applied the same philosophies within an old-mentality league. Modle was faster and sharper than other teams as they didn't ""route-one"". Modle have not won any trophies under Ole since 2012/13. 
2. When he joined Cardiff, Ole promised the fans that they would play ""fast, exciting football"" and that they would dramatically reshape the foundation of the club. He instead got them into the relegation zone and signed too many players that did not adhere to any type of style. His singings from Molde were particularly worrisome as they couldn't get into the team nor adapt. When he was fired from Cardiff they were in a far worse position than when Ole came into the club. 

This is not an #OleOut thread but I feel like these points should be discussed more. Molde were the first Norwegian team to play ""modern-day football"" but they were soon caught up by their rivals. Ole still hasn't made any real impact with these players and our constant changing on formations begins to show our lack of a plan. AWB (great) and James (good hopefully) are good signings as a start BUT Ole essentially acknowledged that we needed far more in this summer. Ed is not solely in charge of transfers. The actual transfer system is complicated as there are so many different departments involved. Matt Judge is our chief negotiator and he evidently sucks. The scouting network is involved and the management needs to also have their say on targets. It is true that the once-great Manchester United are now rapidly declining in terms of their pull.",reddevils

- Quality Sports investments bought 40% of player's economic rights when he was 16 by making a payment of 1m.

- Saul has a 136m release clause at Atletico right now (from other reports) but only 60% of it would be paid to Atletico while rest 40% would go to QSI (headed by Jorge Mendes and former United executive Peter Kenyon)

- If QSI agrees to transfer and Saul doesn't, Atletico will be forced to pay 40% of 135m, so 54m to QSI and the full ownership of the player would be transferred to Atletico Madrid.

2457,0,0,Rule Updates and Reminders - Title Formatting And Trolling Rival Subs,"Greetings City fans! 

Welcome to the Puma era, and welcome to the first day of the new football season. Isn't it good to be back?

While Zinchenko has been off stalking journalists in California, Mendy has been off sitting on a surgeons table in Barcelona ~~and Pep has been signing contracts in Turin~~, the mod team have been sitting back, can of Carabao in hand, relaxing and recharging, reflecting on the season we've just had.

Inevitably reflecting turns to an itchy desire to inflict our ideals on the community we ~~dictate~~ oversee.

Gabriel Jesus has claimed the number 9 shirt this summer, and to celebrate we thought we would introduce a ninth subreddit rule to commemorate this occasion.

-----

##New Rule - Posts must be descriptive, factual and relevant

There has been a notable decline in the quality of posts and titles recently, and we are looking to nip this in the bud as silly season steps up a gear.

Going forward we will be taking a closer look at posts and titles and removing those that do not meet minimum standards.

###Goals and Other Videos

Eg. Gabriel Jesus scores a goal at the Copa America. You wish to post this to to /r/mcfc and revel in the moment with your fellow City fans. There are a few ways you could post this to the community, but some are better than others:

**A goal should be posted as a video**. Not a screenshot of a goal, not self post with your hot take, not a self post with a link to the video inside. Just post the video as a link, either by uploading to reddit, or by linking to the streamable or alternative provider.

The title is important as well. We will remove poorly thought out titles. **Jesus SCORES A GOAL** will get removed. **Gabriel Jesus goal (1-0 vs Argentina) Copa America** or similar will allow your post to remain, and you will soak up all that sweet sweet karma

###Transfer Rumours, Articles

Going forward all titles must have the source in brackets, where relevant, to start off, for example:

&gt; **[SOURCE] Information (not your opinion) and direct link to either the twitter/article source.**

eg. This is what we are looking for:

&gt; [Sam Lee] Mendy Ruled out for entire season with knee issue

We will be removing posts like this:

&gt; What do we all think of this?

All transfer self posts will be deleted (unless it pertains to an actual discussion of a player rather than a rumour. All transfer related posts will be removed unless presented in the correct format with it being a link + source in brackets.

All **click-bait titles will be removed**. This will help all users quickly see the relevant information at a glance. 

Obviously there will be some small exceptions, please remember to add relevant information to the title and present it as a link to the source, then all is good.

###Match Threads (+ Pre/Post)

It should be obvious which posts are Match Threads and (the same goes for Pre and Post Match Threads).

Fancy starting a pre match thread? Feel free! Add the opponent and the competition to the title, add **[Pre Match Thread]** to the start, add some info to the description about the opponent and lets get the discussion going! The mods will sticky your post and everyone is happy.

Match Threads can be started by the community or with MatchThreader or LiveCommentator. The links for both and how to summon them are in the sidebar. If you do start a match thread yourself, add **[Match Thread]** to the title, and make sure to mention the team we're playing.

Post Match threads gets abused the most, the karma race can lead to some poor titles. We want **[Post Match Thread]** to be at the start, and we want to opponent and score in the title. Anything low effort will be removed, and we will favour a better formatted post. A description is helpful and if you're feeling adventurous, add some goals or highlights to the description.

It is not the responsibility of the mods to post any of these threads, you can do it if you wish. The mods will try and post them if nothing has happened.

###Pictures

We love seeing your pictures of your experience at the ground, or relevant pictures. They should be described properly though. if your picture just says something like **Check This Out!** then we will remove it. If you describe what is in the picture a bit, then we have no reason to remove it and the community know what they're getting before they click on the title. **Just a single emoji as the title is unacceptable.**

If you're going to post a picture of a key moment in the game, have a think about whether it would be better served as a video. The recent example that springs to mind is Jesus's penalty goal in the Copa America, which was posted as a screenshot from before he kicked the ball and offered no value.

###Players Social Media

Sometimes a player does something on social media and you want to post it to our sub. That's great, content is king. Follow the same rules as above. If Mendy has gone on a bender, a sentence explaining what his video contains is valuable information. **Mendy polishes Pep's head with shoe polish** tells me everything I need to know, I'm already salivating at the thought of watching this video. Just calling the video **Lol Mendy absolute bantz** is absolutely useless and will lead to removal.

###Overall

The golden rule is to think about what you're contributing to the community, an extra 10 seconds thinking about your title helps others engage with your content much more easily.

If in doubt, ask.

##Updated Rule - Trolling or Brigading of Rival Subreddits

We have removed a rule referencing the messaging of mods as it was a bit vague and not really enforceable. This has been replaced by a new rule about the trolling or brigading of rival subreddits. This is something we have been enforcing for a while, but not sits as one of our key rules to make yourself familiar with.

It is a simple rule. Any users found to be causing trouble on a rival subreddit, and who are reported to us by that subreddit, will risk being banned from that subreddit as well /r/mcfc as a result. We also report trolls to other subreddits.

This does not affect /r/soccer. Do what you want over there.

-----

##Other Business

A quick reminder of the other 7 rules that we have, they're all visible on the side bar, the link is called **Subreddit rules**.

As before we be removing any comments which are aggressive in nature (Rule: Don't be a dick), and any spam (Rule: Don't spam). Posts that have nothing to do with City will also be removed (Rule: Stay on topic). We are a lenient bunch, so if your post is about the CFG or a wider topic relevant to the club, that is acceptable. Got a really cool bot that you want to show off which says hi to people when they say ""I'm""? That is an unhelpful bot (Rule: No unhelpful bots). That earns the bot a ban.

You are allowed to give the club stick here, and you can complain or point out things you don't like. You can even have a discussion about the moral dilemma you've had to wrestle with by supporting a club owned by someone who is from the Middle East. What you can't do is come in with an anti-city attitude (Rule: No City-bashing). Opinions are fine and respected. Deliberate attempts to cause drama result in a ban.

It would be great if you could post in the relevant thread (Rule: Post in the relevant thread where possible), or create one if you feel it is needed. If there is already a thread about the new Puma kit (there is), then that is the best place for it. New material can have it's own post, and if it is related but warrants it's own post that is fine (like a new video showing Mendy hurting his knee in the new Puma kit). 

Finally, rival fans are still not welcome here, any kind of spamming or non-constructive comment will result in bans, and we do actively report the users to their home team subreddit (Rule: Rival fans must contribute constructively). If you're a rival fan and you genuinely want to ask a question or have a discussion, that is fine, we are a nice bunch. If you want to brag about your team's wonderful defender or point out that the club is financed by slavery, then I'm afraid you'll have to take that elsewhere.

-----

## And Finally

If you see any violations of these rules, please report them to the mods and we will take a look as quickly as possible. If you think you've been unfairly banned or had your post removed, speak to us and we will help resolve the issue.

We hope that you find these rules beneficial going forward and that they help to make the experience on /r/mcfc more enjoyable. As always, feel free to give the mods feedback on these changes.",MCFC

2466,9,9,18/19 Player Reviews: A Crowdsourced Compilation [OC],"\[Satire Warning\]

&amp;#x200B;

Now that the season is well and truly over and the new season about to ramp up, I thought I'd take the time to review the players in the squad ahead of the new season. In order to do so, I have collated thousands of tweets, journalistic articles, opinion pieces and data points. I've taken terabytes of Opta data and fed all of this into an advanced AI neural network with machine learning, to come out with the average crowdsourced review of every player, based on fact.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goalkeepers**

&amp;#x200B;

Ederson

*A good goalkeeper capable of stopping shots with his body and also able to kick with his feet. Benefits from having an expensive defense ahead of him. Never been tested.*

Muric

*A goalkeeper. Never been tested.*

Bravo

*Round of applause*

&amp;#x200B;

**Defenders**

&amp;#x200B;

Walker

*A fast right footed player who benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. English. A liability. Never been tested.*

Danilo

*A former Real Madrid player. Never been played. 50 yard screamer sails over the bar*

Stones

*An English defender with girlfriend troubles. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Never been tested.*

Mendy

*Injured. Benefits from being in the most expensive knee surgery in the world.*

Delph

*In the dog house. English. Should be nowhere near Manchester*

Zinchenko

*Not a LB. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Never been tested.*

Mangala

*Ded.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Midfield**

&amp;#x200B;

Sane

*Wants to go to Bayern. Can't track back. Pep doesn't like him. Has a mother. Fast. Long hair.*

Sterling

*Black. Known to buy things. Breakthrough season. English. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world.*

Bernado Silva

*Only won 5 trophies. Can fill in for absentees. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world.*

Silva

*Old. Slow. Magic. Merlin. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world.*

De Bruyne

*De Injure*

Mahrez

*Waste of money. Bench warmer. ¬£60 million on a substitute. Penalty miss.*

Fernandinho

*The second coming of Christ. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Tactical fouls. Shithouserey. Yellow card*

Gundogan

*Present. Not injured. DM. 8. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Turkish. German.*

Foden

*Not being given a chance. Does not benefit from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Should move to obscure German team*

&amp;#x200B;

**Fowards**

&amp;#x200B;

Aguero

*Short. Near post. Not as good as Henry.*

Jesus

*Young. Offside. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Never scores. Only scores tap ins.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Manager**

&amp;#x200B;

Guardiola

*Fraud. Fourmidable. Juventus. Hates Sane. Bottles CL. Can't win withough Messi. Benefits from owning the most expensive squad in the world*",MCFC

Ederson

Otamendi - Stones - Laporte

Bernardo - De Bruyne - Rodri - Gundogan - San√©

Jesus - Ag√ºero 


First of all, I would love to see Gabriel Jesus and Ag√ºero playing a full 90 match together. I‚Äôm not sure if it has happened before, but it would be interesting to see how the team would fare with two deadly strikers up front. Second of all, having two people like Rodri and Gundogan would offer a lot of defensive security with a line-up like this considering that the team would have a three man back line. Overall, I just like the idea of seeing Jesus and Ag√ºero playing together in a very offensive line-up.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I will be visiting for a week on September 21st and are trying to determine the best way to make it to the Watford match at the Etihad.  Unfortunately, it looks like we will be on a tight schedule with our plane arriving at London Heathrow @ 10:45am.

&amp;#x200B;

We are wondering if you guys had recommendations on the best ways to get up to the game (right now it says 15:00 (3pm) game time) in a timely fashion.  

* We see that we should have train options that may leave Heathrow at 11:18am and arrive at Manchester Piccadilly at 14:47 (2:27pm).  
   * Is this a reasonable option, are trains usually pretty on time in the area (on a weekend?).  In America that is almost never the case.  
   * We are traveling with backpacks only.  Are there any places to store a backpack during the game?
   * Last time I was in London the customs/immigration went pretty quickly (about 20 minutes) but who knows?

&amp;#x200B;

* We could rent a car and drive up which appears to be about the same time commitment but our concern is about parking around the stadium and whether it is reasonable or if there are tips to parking just far enough away for it to make sense. Again, we are traveling with backpacks only but having a car gives us a place to store our belonging during the game.

&amp;#x200B;

* This one is kind of a long shot, but our friends live in Warrington and we could take the train to Warrington to arrive at 14:14 (2:14pm) and then try to drive the rest of the way (which would save us from having to rent a car and also give us a place to stash out backpacks)

&amp;#x200B;

We also have an option to try to get Everton tickets on the following weekend.  Is that a more reasonable request or should we focus our energy on getting to the Etihad?

Once you‚Äôre signed up you‚Äôll want to join our league. *Best league in the land and all the world!* To do that, you‚Äôll need a code. Our code this season is:

Once you‚Äôre joined in the league head back to the sub and brag **in this thread** about how awesome your team is. Mines already mint. I‚Äôve got de Bruyne because he‚Äôs gonna boss it this season. There‚Äôs no rules on who you have in your team. If you want mid-table mediocrity to save a few mil then, sure, go for Pogba. Your mistakes are your mistakes. 

Just so we‚Äôre clear, this is for fun. There‚Äôs no fee to enter, it‚Äôs all free, and there are no prizes for winning. You‚Äôll just win the knowledge that you‚Äôre basically the FPL version of Guardiola. Anyone finishing at the bottom, sorry, you‚Äôre basically Tony Pulis. 

Remember it‚Äôs just a laugh so don‚Äôt take it too seriously and don‚Äôt take 6 weeks to pick your team because you might just miss out. **I will be closing entry to the league the day the season starts ie 09/08/19.** You have been warned.

2630,173,173,The new long term captain,"I've been thinking a lot about this since David Silva's announcement. Regrettably, I don't think Aguero and Fernandinho will be around for another 2 seasons. These are the three senior players I'd expect to be captain after Kompany however their short term solutions. That leaves the question of who?  They would need to be almost certain starters and have a big presence in the squad. Below are my reasons for and against 3 players that could be in contention. Comment below your thoughts  


**Kevin De Bruyne**

Loved by fans, time and time again Kevin has shown how important he is on the field. To many, he would be the ideal choice. For starters, he's a big game player, scoring winning goals against PSG, United, Chelsea for example. However, I can't help think back to one moment in 2017. Kevin 'loses his cool' at the end of a game against Napoli. Shouting ""Let me talk"" towards David Silva and Fernandinho. He's not afraid to show his emotions, reportedly being furious at Pep for subbing him off against Burton in January 2019. Was this just passion or could his frustrations land him in trouble while dealing with refs every game?

&amp;#x200B;

**Raheem Sterling**

Raheem's career seemed to have stagnated while under Manuel Pellegrini. Luckily for us, Pep Guardiola and influence from Mikel Arteta turned the player from 11 goals and 10 assists in 47 appearances to 25 goals and 18 assists in 51 appearances. But, numbers don't make a captain. In the last few months, he has shown great maturity off the pitch, Donating a large amount towards those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire and accusing the British media of fueling racism. However, do you think Raheem shows this level of maturity on the field? Well, he was given England captaincy for his 50th appearance. Gareth Southgate must see some leadership quality there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Aymeric Laporte**

Laporte played in 35/38 Premier League games last season. A rock at the back he never seems to complain and gets on with the job. A quality you would want from every player. At the moment he a certain starter above all the other centre backs at the club. Does his command at the back make the power defender capable to be the captain or is it too soon to tell in his early City career?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. I'm sure there are a lot more points for and against each of these players that ive not even touched on. Personally, for me it's between Kevin and Raheem however I feel both lack maturity on the field at the moment which can change in the next year in time for Davids departure Maybe could it even be someone else? John Stones? Bernardo Silva? or even Delph???",MCFC

2675,218,218,Do we really need Maguire?,"With all the reports that have been flying around about us going for Maguire and paying ¬£80m for him, potentially breaking the VVD record fee, I really feel we're going to be criminally overspending on an average defender.

I get Maguire is good and he's experienced and all that jazz. But is it really justified to spend 80m on him? No offence to whoever likes him, but he's really not worth more than 50m. We could easily promote Garcia or Sandler and give them the 4th choice spot, with Fernandinho stepping in when necessary. Dinho was great as a CB when he's been deployed there last season, he has the intelligence as well as the experience and physicality to excel there.

Also, there are a lot more defenders currently, who imo are as good, if not better than Maguire. Skriniar is one. Koulibaly is out of the picture for now sadly, though spending this much on him would be justified. Alderweireld is another really worth candidate. 

We could get Alderweireld for a measly sum who would give us enough backup for a good season which would give Stones and Laporte some more time to cement that partnership. It would also give us time to look at other better options in a year.

Does anyone else feel this is a real waste of money?",MCFC

The crazy rumors of him going to Juve that so many so called ‚ÄúTier 1‚Äù italian journalists got wrong is probably him or Juve laying the groundwork and planting the seed for his eventual arrival, the same way Pep was rumored heavily in Pelligrini‚Äôs last season.

The arrival of Sarri to implement a similar style of play to Pep‚Äôs and to ease the transition from Allegri‚Äôs more rigid style, the same way Pelligrini was seen as a good transition to Pep from Mancini.

The future squad planning. This ones a bit of a reach but Pep was heavily rumored to have chosen Sterling, KDB and Sane while still being Bayern manager. The acquisition of De Ligt could be seen in a similar light and maybe could‚Äôve been the deciding factor for him to join Juve ahead of Barca and co.

An average net spend of ¬£88m over the last 11 seasons. I personally HATE net spend. Its for stupid people to use when in reality it ignores so many other pieces of how tranfers are worked on the books. In reality transfers account for a few things:

1) Length of contract

2) Transfer fee

3) Wages

4) Contract Expiry/Transfer Income when said player leaves

Thats how a transfer should be calculated. Looking at transfer at facevalue can be quite silly. To give an example of David Silva who lets say for this argument has been on ¬£200k a week for the entire time he has been here. With a fee off ¬£25m + 9 years at the club + 1 more. David Silva would have served 10 years. Thus his transfer fee on the actual books per accounting terms is 25/10 = a measly ¬£2.5m per year due to amortisation. With 200k a week at ¬£9.6m per year wages David Silva costs Manchester City on the books at ¬£9.6m + ¬£2.5m =¬£12.1m per year. This is one of the reasons City like to extend contracts early in their life so they can further spread the transfer fee over the life of the contract. So in reality the transfer fee of ¬£2.5m per year starts of bigger and gets smaller of time. Its probably closer to ¬£1-2m depending on when his extensions were signed. Gundogan for example who only has 1 year left on his contract per transfer fee amortisation we would have mostly paid off his transfer fee on the books and are almost only at wages. 

Hope thats not confusing!

----------------------

Alas back into our transfer books

The first 3 seasons of our spending in the Mansour era basically went unaccounted for. The owner was basically dumping money into the club left right and centre. A big chunk of our initial spend lies there with us spending a whopping **¬£483,450,000** in those first 3 seasons. This is what I call the ""catch up"" phase. There is no doubt in my mind that Manchester City squad was wayyy behind the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, and Arsenal. So we essentially had to spend a lot to catch up if we wanted to compete with the big clubs. This is the only time you could actually say City were ""ruining football"" and thats purely because the fees at the time were high and we had to spend over the odds to go quick. Though by the 11/12 season we had AGUERRROOOOOd our first PL title.  So fuck it!

Manchester City first started to get implications of potential FFP implications around 2011 to 2013 with an eventual fine and squad limitation in 2014. These same issues are cropping up again from the same time period - our books are good in the present but we might again get punished for wrong doings in 2014 (Can I get a fuck UEFA?). This is why in the seasons between 11/12 to 14/15 season we only had a net spend of ¬£180m over 4 years. This is what Khaldoon described as a pinch that effectively slowed City down because they had to get legitimate streams of revenue to do any further club improvement as per the rules City were no longer allowed to get money from Mansour direclty anymore. 

So we effectively have had to do 2 catch up periods due to FFP. We caught up in 11/12 then stagnated back down. Although we won the PL in 2014 just take a look at the 3 seasons afterwards where we only 1 trophy during that period (league cup in 2016, can i get a fuck Liverpool?) as our squad was aging/not good enough. 


##  [](#icon-notes-big) **New TV money + commercial revenue hugely increased**


After that period we finally were able to freely spend again and with the coming of Pep Guardiola it was time to invest wisely in the squad and get back to the top. In the last 4 seasons we have spent a massive **¬£662,900,000** or a netspend of **¬£426,250,000**. A lot of opposing fans will tell you that we must be cheating or the owner is dropping money to do this. 

A netspend of ¬£426,250,000 over 4 years is really not that much with the amount of revenue that comes in. The good thing about City is that the owners DO NOT take money out of the club at all. Every ounce it makes stays within the club. We also have 0 debt. In comparison take a look at what [Uniteds](https://i.redd.it/b4hxwon8ud531.jpg) owners are doing and yet are still able to have a netspend of around ¬£300m in the same time period. 

## [](#icon-notes-big) **Looking at Individual Players** 

I have seen a lot of opposing fans like to claim that Citys buys have always been poor and they just go out and spend another 100m to fix the issue. 

Till this day our record Transfer fee is Riyad Mahrez at ¬£60m 

In the Mansour era we have probably bought around 70-100 players into the first team and obviously most have left or been sold in that time frame. We have also bought a lot of youth who we are starting to see fees coming back from. 

### The bad and TBDs Over the last 11 years 

Suprisingly we havent done too many blunders in our years of spending. You can never nail every transfers for sure but I was acutally suprised how few we have got wrong since the takeover.

|Scott Sinclair|¬£8,000,000|Bad|¬£3,500,000|-¬£4,500,000|3|2|¬£1,500,000|
|Totals|¬£311,700,000||¬£94,150,000|¬£137,450,000|||¬£79,895,833|


So over 11 years of transfers we have essentially lost ¬£137m to bad transfers. With a lot of those contracts majority spending it out on loan so on the books we probably werent paying their wages but only the bad transfer fee.  (I made up the mangala sell fee of ¬£5m because having that not count here is really bad lol)

The fee spread is a good way to visualise how much it roughly cost us per season on the books. 


Nothings hits me more than when opposing fans say we just buy any and every play at 40-50m and if they dont work we just buy another. Looking at this we have only had a few poor transfers in the last few seasons. Everything else was almost 5 seasons ago.

----------------------------------

## [](#icon-ball)[](#icon-net) **Some stats:**


- In the 11 years since the take over Manchester City have spent  ¬£30m or more a total of only 15 times

- Over ¬£40m a total of 8 times

- Over ¬£50m a total of 4 times

- Over ¬£60m a **grand total of 0 fucken times**

- Of players at or over ¬£30m they have been demed good transfers 13 out of 15 times. Take out Mendy and itll go down to 12 out of 15 times. Thats a success rate of 87% -  pretty good if you ask me. 


With this youll see the club is in immaculately healthy position players and fee wise. 


So when opposing fans tell you Manchester City are ruining football. Tell them kindly to fuck off lol. 

Final note: Rodriguez is about to ruin my over ¬£60m transfer fee due to his ‚Ç¨70m release clause which due to current conversion rates becomes ¬£62.1m (BOOOOO!!!) - Fuck it though he is going to be amazing and is only 22 years old. 5 years in when he is hitting his peak that fee will look tiny when Clubs will be paying ¬£100m for Delph like players.",MCFC

2749,292,292,Rodri stats compared to Fernandinho and Busquets,"Since yesterday I am hyped for Rodri and can't wait for him to sign for us. I was checking how well he would be suited to City and his stats say it all. I compared his 18/19 season with 17/18 Fernandinho and 15/16 Busquets. I believe 17/18 and 15/16 were the best seasons for Ferna and Busquets respectively. This is what I found

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Stat|Rodri (18/19)|Fernandinho(17/18)|Busquets(15/16)|

|Avg Rating (Whoscored)|7.24| **7.44** |7.28|

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From the above stats it is pretty evident that Rodri is defensively almost par with prime Fernandinho and Busquets whereas has scope for improvement offensively. Being 22 and with Pep as his coach, I am pretty confident he can only improve and will become one of the best DMs to have ever played. 

&amp;#x200B;

The standout stat for me is Bad control per game. I thought Fernandinho almost never had a bad touch and Rodri's stat is better than Ferna.",MCFC

2806,349,349,[ITK] Transfer update - one deal should be done next week,"Take this with a grain of salt or get all excited but tolmie the ITK posted this below:



Sounding optimistic we could have at least one in next week.

I would expect it to be Rodri.

Don't count out de Ligt just yet. The player has asked again about Pep and City.

There are hurdles (some are more obvious than others)

He's feeling the pressure a little in terms of all the interest. Worryingly, Liverpool have also started some sort of charm offensive.

Maguire is considered at least ¬£20m too expensive and doesn't represent the value we want from making City's next centre half the most expensive in the world.

Mino certainly has food for thought.

If Leroy goes, Felix comes. Zinchenko and Walker new deals to be announced when they return.

Muric wanted on loan by two Premier League clubs.

Don't think Otamendi is leaving as things stand, maybe Vinny going has changed that.

No real update on Leroy. Bravo staying for final year.

If I'm not signed up as a Cityzen do I have any chance at getting tickets for this game? How long before the match do tickets typically go on sale online for Cityzens and/or General sale? Just looking for any advice you guys can give me about getting tickets as I don't really know how it works and what the demand is like (I assume it will be pretty high for this game as its the first home game of the season and its Tottenham).

However, I find very few people stating the obvious:

Given the credible nature of some of these sources, what may be the case is Pep has already signed a forward contract with Juve that‚Äôs now sitting in a safe somewhere. What those terms and conditions are, we may never know. What we do know is this is exactly how it happened when Pep joined City from Bayern. Pep had already starting advising City on potential targets as early as a year before he joined. Starling the most famous one. 

Also, most people don‚Äôt remember this, but Bayern fans were shocked and left bitter Pep was leaving. Some players even admitted they were caught unaware. Especially after culling a CL /WC winning squad and never delivering the CL himself. Regardless of the trophies he brings in the coming 2 years, I doubt Pep will want to repeat anything like that again. When he says he is here for another 2 years, I believe him. But I don‚Äôt think he wants us to read too much into it beyond that. 

City is bigger than one man. Our competitive advantage comes from us being a well oiled machine. And that means being good at smoothing out transitions. I think that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening here.

1) City's owner is actually an investor who invests in lot of things (examples are given in the thread), including football. Hence this is an investment not a PR exercise. This is also supported by numbers that city is profittable lsat 4 years. The club value is estimated at 2.2 bn while he says the investment (total) is around 1.3 bn.

&amp;#x200B;

Kun Notes:

\- It's Kun...there's not a lot that you guys aren't well aware of.

\- Insanely consistent bagging 33, 30, then 32 goals. Minute totals of 3500, 2900, and 3400.

\- The threat of GJ was exactly what he needed.

\- Personal opinion for next season is that he plays slightly less minutes and hopefully puts up 34-40 goals as we start bedding in GJ. He could easily get 40+ rotation is obviously key.

&amp;#x200B;

Gabriel Jesus Notes:

\- Embracing the role of deputy with great morale which had to be difficult considering he was first choice not long after coming in on fire and especially with those two injuries.

\- Has a lot of work to do timing his runs and will get better as a finisher. We're blessed with Kun so I think that diminishes Gabby to a degree. The fact of the matter is that he scores goals when he plays and the squad doesn't significantly drop off either.

\- Constantly coming in as a SUB and without a long run of starts weakens his numbers but as a number 2 and potential long term replacement he's been perfect for us these past 2 and a half seasons and I'm not sure that we win two league cups and the FA without him.

\- There's been chatter over the years about fans not being sure if he can lead the line with Kun out and I'm 100% convinced that's bogus. There's also been chatter about not trust him for the big games and that also is 100% bogus. I ran the PL data on games he started / played over 45 minutes and it came back with a 30-4-1 record which is on pace for 102 points. I also ran though those games looking for matches vs top teams and he's excelled every time he's been given the chance. He's started Spurs away, Chelsea away, and vs LFC. We won all 3, he scored 3 and assisted 1. Obviously there was the cup final where he scored 2 and assisted 1 as well.

\- He's not ready yet but I hope he gets more chances in bigger games.

\- Personal Opinion for next season is that he gets close to 2800 minutes and threatens 30 goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Kelechi Notes:

\- Super bummed that it's not working out for him because he always seemed to get the job done when he was called upon. Obviously he had to leave but thanks Kelechi for missing that easy goal vs us!",MCFC

2980,523,523,Man Utd and Man City make moves for Joao Felix in ¬£120m battle with Real Madrid,"Manchester United and City are embroiled in a ¬£120million tug of war with Real Madrid for Portugal whizkid Joao Felix.

Both Premier League clubs will have scouts watching Benfica teenager Felix in Portugal‚Äôs Nations League semi-final against Switzerland in Porto on Wednesday night.

United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has targeted Portugal‚Äôs latest footballing sensation as he begins the rebuilding of his team after a disappointing season.

But he faces fierce competition from Real, who are desperate to land the Benfica teenager, City and also Italian giants Juventus.

Benfica want around ¬£120million and Real have already seen an opening bid of around ¬£80m rejected.

But they are now expected to use Benfica‚Äôs interest in goalkeeper Keylor Navas to try to clinch a deal next week after the finals.

Felix, 19, scored 18 goals in 33 games for Benfica this season and became the youngest player to score a Europa League hat trick since Sergio Aguero when he netted three against Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter finals in April.

The teenager is set to make his senior debut for Portugal against the Swiss in Porto, after being called up for the finals by coach Fernando Santos

For the uninitiated, numerous very reliable Italian journalists, including the guy that same CR7 would go to Juventus, have stated that it is certain Pep Guardiola will be announced as Juventus manager on 4th June, with an official unveiling on 14th June. Join us for all the build up to this defining moment of the summer.

All we've had from City's side so far is unreliable guys like a board member and Pep Guardiola denying the claims, so without any credible sources, we can only assume that this is going ahead.

2984,527,527,Mendy needs to be replaced or scared into reality,"Benjamin Mendy has only made 17 league appearances in his 2 years on the blue side of Manchester compared to his 1 year in ligue 1 with monoco where he made 8 more appearances with 25. In my opinion he is a liability and Pep Guardiola should highly consider out right replacing him or buying another left-back to put some fear in mendy. I could easily make the argument that with a healthy mendy the title race would've been a lot smoother and maybe we would be talking about champions league glory with that bum rushing, good crossing, and powerful option at left-back. Instead we had an out of position zinchenko at left-back which I must say he did a job but he wasn't mindblowing. It has been said Guardiola will be giving him another chance which I could get behind as long as we go out and buy someone to give him a run for his money. I would be very happy with buying a chilwell or a Tierney from Celtic this would get Mendy off of the social media and focusing on his fitness and his place in the squad. Also we must say the Premier league is a way more physical league then the French league he has already shown to be injury prone so we must get another recruit for that side of the back line. Just to finish this off I should let you know I am a fan of mendy and his abilities he obviously is a world class left back but if we want to continue our dominance in England and progressing in Europe I believe this is a problem position based on Benjamin's attitude and fitness. Anyone agree?",MCFC
2985,528,528,San√© interest from Bayern fades!,"According to the dutch-speaking online football transfer site Voetbalprimeur, Bayern's interest in San√© is fading away.

Despite the M√ºnich giants seeing San√© as they perfect replacement for Robben and Rib√©ry, they are not willing to meet Manchester City's demands after they saw a 80 million euro bid rejected.

Hoeness told the German press (Kicker) that it's about insane price-tags. Hence he does not see the move happening.

3015,558,558,Man City identify three midfield summer transfer targets,"Source : Sky Sports


Manchester City are monitoring three midfielders as they continue their pursuit of a replacement for Fernandinho.

According to Manchester evening news,¬†Atletico Madrid midfielder¬†Rodri¬†remains City's No.1 target but the Blues are not pinning all of their hopes on landing the 22-year-old.

Rodri has a release clause of ‚Ç¨70million at Atletico but City are hopeful of signing him for a lower fee.

Should that not be possible City may look elsewhere, with Lyon's¬†Tanguy Ndombele¬†and Real Madrid's¬†Marco Llorente¬†both on the Blues' radar.
Ndombele shone for Lyon in their Champions League win at the Etihad at the beginning of the campaign.

Lyon reportedly rejected a bid from Tottenham for the 22-year-old midfielder earlier this week.

Llorente, meanwhile, endured an injury-ravaged campaign at Madrid and managed just 16 appearances in all competitions.

City are determined to sign Fernandinho's long-term successor this summer after losing out to Chelsea in their pursuit of Jorginho last year.
It had looked for all the world like the Italy international would move to the Etihad only for the lure of moving to London and working with Maurizio Sarri to turn his head at the 11th hour.

Fernandinho turns 35 next season and injury forced him to miss almost a quarter of City's Premier League games over the course of their title-winning campaign.

The Germany international Ilkay Gundogan proved himself to be an able deputy for Fernandinho in the run-in but there are doubts surrounding his long-term future at the club, despite his insistence that he is keen to renew his contract in Manchester.",MCFC

[Another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6x2L6MOF04) vs Chelsea in 2013

[And another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrSxqAEDVHs) vs Manchester United in 2013 after a superb run

Not to mention, the [greatest goal of them all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcpFrQJVt3s) was a near post one too!

Do you think he's the best near post finisher in the world? The dude probably practices scoring from corners in training",MCFC

3091,634,634,"Atletico are worried about a ‚Äòsoap opera‚Äô developing over Rodri. Los Rojiblancos would like the situation sorted soon, whether that means a move to City or a new deal. Rodri is delighted with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãplaying in the Premier League and is very tempted by City.",,MCFC

3094,637,637,Would you be happy if City spent more than 100M on a player?,"I know we are labelled as the big spenders but we buy pretty efficiently (well since Pep, Mangala I am looking at you) and can't think of who we need that will strengthen us this summer. Only player I can think of is Kai Havertz, the kid looks something special and would be over 100m, there is obviously Mbappe but i think he has too big an ego for us lot. This has got me thinking because Joao Felix being labelled over 100m is shocking and I would be dissappointed if we pay that. 

Just an FYI - the major player we need to sign is De Ligt and just pay whatever just not over 100m (don't know what it is but triggers me being 3 digits)",MCFC
3095,638,638,City abroad,"So i have been living abroad for over a year and havn‚Äôt been to a game since our trashing of spurs in December 2017. Missed so much but still watch when the time difference allows. Honestly I love the club and miss going to matcha  terribly but that‚Äôs life unfortunately. seen I saw that city are coming to near where I live on their summer tour got exited for like 5 minutes then realized I will be visiting back home when it‚Äôs on.... to say I‚Äôm mildly upset is an understatement

3096,639,639,Can we dead the whining?,"We‚Äôve just won the domestic treble, had the best two seasons in history, we have a great core of players that will only get even better, and most of all we have one of the best managers of all time with us for at least another two years.

Despite this, I‚Äôm seeing a lot of pointless moaning. About not being on the front/back pages of papers. About Liverpool getting more credit for the season. About the media bias against City, and the criticism of our owners. Why does any of this matter? Who gives a shit whether we‚Äôre the headline in the Telegraph? Why are we arsed about what boring media heads talking about Liverpool more than us? Why do we automatically assume that reports on our ownership are hit pieces, when there are massive, legitimate concerns with them?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time rolling my eyes at BT and calling McManaman or whoever a twat (he is a fucking twat) but on here it‚Äôs endless complaining about bias and exposure, and it‚Äôs just sad to see.

I realise how hypocritical this post seems, but it‚Äôs just frustrating to see so little joy and so much bitterness, I think we could all do with just cheering up and blocking out the noise from the media, it doesn‚Äôt mean anything whatsoever.",MCFC

So with that in mind, and given bernardo's proficiency on the wing, should we be signing a midfielder to replace bernardo, or a winger to replace sane? 

I know we all envisioned bernardo as the dave heir, but it's very clear now that bernardo is not any worse, if not better, on the wing  which is also where pep likes him as of now. 

If we're getting winger, then we we're looking at a ridiculously expensive joao felix. I don't know how i feel about potentially paying more for felix than we're getting for sane. 

If we're getting a MF then there were the talks of bruno earlier that were debunked, as well as whispers tielemans this morning. I would also like to throw Kai Havertz in there. He's really talented and bayern's been after him for some time. Nothing would make me happier than sticking it to bayern after all the shenanigans their boards been pulling.

So what does everyone think? I'm hoping over everything else that he stays, but thought it might be worth having a discussion who we potentially want in.",MCFC

In general - defending corners and set pieces which has been poor for a couple of seasons now

Jesus - staying onsides and lower body strength/balance so he doesn't get pushed off the ball so easily

Mahrez - shot accuracy, too many balls 10 rows into the stands

Walker - better accuracy and timeliness with his crosses &amp; staying calm in high pressure situations

Sane - his attitude and work rate seems like they can be greatly improved

Mendy - staying healthy?",MCFC

I would like to remind you  Carles Puyol retired at the end of the 2013/14 season and Barcelona went on to win the Treble the following 2014/15 season, without Puyol.

As you probably know we‚Äòve been heavily linked with San√©. I have been following him since his early Schalke days and I would love it if we signed him. I was pretty bummed out when we missed out on him.

Now to my question: you hear all kinds of different sources saying different things. Some say his relationship with Pep is not good and some say they get along fine. Some say he wants to return to Germany and some say he wants to have another go at City.

I think you guys know the most, since you‚Äòre the fans of the club lol. So, what is San√©‚Äôs situation at City? Is there a possibility that he signs for Bayern in this transfer window? I know he won‚Äôt be cheap (¬£80m at the lowest but probably more like ¬£100m) but I think we might be okay with paying that much for a German player with that kind of quality and ceiling.

Appreciate all the answers and good luck in the next season!",MCFC
3164,707,707,[OC] Are Manchester City the team of the decade?,"Domestically I think we've taken the crown for the team of the decade!

|Manchester City|15.0|
|Chelsea|14.5|
|Manchester United|7.5|
|Arsenal|4.5|
|Liverpool|1.0|
|Spurs|0|

-------------------
the next logical thing to look at is consistency, and to do that we look at table finishes

Manchester city lead this by a staggering point and a bit. With an average finish of 2.3. 

|Year|Man City|Chelsea|Man United|Arsenal|Tottenham|Liverpool|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|

|2019|1|3|6|5|4|2|
|Average|2.3|3.5|3.6|3.9|4.1|5.4|

We smash this out of the park! With my made up number system I'll give 6 points to City and count downwards from there to an updated table of:

|Team|Points|
:--|--:|
|Manchester City|21|
|Chelsea|19.5|
|Manchester United|11.5|
|Arsenal|7.5|
|Liverpool|2|
|Spurs|2|



The next thing I want to look at is top 4 finishes and top 6 finishes. To me if you aren't 1st, then 2nd, 3rd and 4th are pretty much equal as you all make the CL and win nothing. 5th and 6th generally means EL. On this system I'm doing a minus system of no CL =-0.2 

|Team|Points|
:--|--:|
|Manchester City|20.8|
|Chelsea|18.9|
|Manchester United|10.9|
|Arsenal|6.9|
|Spurs|1|
|Liverpool|0.8|



----------


One thing I haven't counted in this calculation is winning the EL I did factor this in for getting CL the next year (example United) but not sure what value to give the trophy? Maybe 1.5?

If so then next week there is the huge implication of Chelsea finishing above us for the team of the decade! And whoever loses the CL final finishes last  on my made up top 6 ladder. 

Hope you enjoyed let me know if I should add or remove anything, or something I've missed!

----------------------------- 

## **From a City point of view** 

------------------------ 

## [](#icon-star-big) Tier Gospel 

- [Man City official](https://twitter.com/ManCity) - The only one that really counts. 

## [](#icon-news-big) **Tier One** 

- [\[Sam Lee\]](https://twitter.com/Sammy_Goal) - Goal - General rule with Sam anything he puts in a tweet or in a reply dont treat it as Tier 1 news, treat it as 2-3+. Anything he prints in an article treat it as Tier 1 news. He has said this multiple times in other Tweets and on Podcasts. The same thing in podcasts hell say something but dont treat it as Tier 1, for example in the last 93:20 podcast he said he has heard rumors about Harry Kane being a City target and an Aguero replacement but wont print it because he just doesn't see it happening but the sources he has heard it off are quite reliable. /u/sammy_goal - he is also are local resident here. 

- [\[Martin Blackburn\]](https://twitter.com/SunMartinB) - The Sun (unfortunately) - Does not print much transfer news but is usually nailed on when he prints something. Youll notice his last tweet is him saying Pep will sign a 2 year extension back in 2017 keeping him for 5 years! 

- [\[Simon Mullock\]](https://twitter.com/MullockSMirror) - The Mirror - The same With Martin, doenst print much but when he does he generally is pretty close and nailed on and has a long history with the club, his articles generally get down-voted to oblivion on /r/soccer due to him from The Mirror which is generally tier 10.  similar to Martin as its The Sun. 

With Tier ones ive seen plenty of people say oh but they said we were in for this and that didnt happen so they are not reliable. 

Youll never see Sam, Martin or Simon ever say, this is ""done"" to City.  Youll see them say the club is interested or strongly believe they land their target. You need to always remember they are talking from the clubs perspective and how they feel as their sources are generally City sources. 

## [](#icon-news-big) **Tier Two** 

- [[Simon Stone (BBC)]](https://twitter.com/sistoney67) - More of a United reporter to be fair but he does get some news on City and is pretty reliable for us especially considering he is from the BBC. The guys above will usually report first and then Simon will afterwards 

- [[Duncan Castles]](https://twitter.com/DuncanCastles)- also more of a united supporter and an anti city one at that. He falls for me between tier 2 and 3. However we can‚Äôt ignore the strong sources he has and he especially has a strong link with Super agent Mendes who represents a lot of city players. 



## [](#icon-news-big) **Tier 3** 

- [\[Jose Alvarez Haya\]](https://twitter.com/10JoseAlvarez) - Spanish Correspondent to Man City - Jose was tier 2 last year, he's been dropped to tier 3. Was great with line up leaks which have stopped as the club put an end to it. Any news he leaks ajohr Aguero though treat it as tier one. He basically gets it from Aguero directly that's definitely been clear over the last 2 years 


**ITKS**

Some ITKs are much more reliable than others but ill bundle them all together as tier 3s ITKS to me are always the funnest because its always from a whisper of news and theres generally something to it but as they are not journalists so they really dont have a reliability and reputation to keep up so as always with ITK's take them with a grain of salt or go crazy over them. 

- [MCFCJustSaying](https://twitter.com/MCFCjustsayin) - twitter ITK

- Tolmie - Bluemoon - ITK

- Ric - BlueMoon Admin

- [BillyShears/Ahsan](https://twitter.com/9320pod) (93:20 pod) 

- MCRJON - BM ITK - Godlike accuracy but hasn't posted since he said Kyle Walker is done in May 2017 (he signed in July...) and seeing Bernardo walk right past him at the CFA...

For other clubs or OUTSIDE sources, example an Italian newspaper talking about a City target from an Italian club look at this as a [guide](https://np.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/bogkgn/transfer_rumour_reliability_guide_summer_2019/). Thanks to /u/spoofex.  If you see a spanish paper talking about a target in Germany going to City its usually bullshit. However a reliable Barcelona paper with ties to Txiki/Pep may have knowledge from anywhere so its always good to know that on a scale of reliability as well.

3183,726,726,Nobody's laughing now as Manchester City become 'the biggest and the best',"It was nine years ago when Garry Cook, the former Manchester City chief executive, popped into the home of the club‚Äôs New York supporters branch for a pint.


‚ÄòThe biggest and best football club in the world,‚Äô he predicted. And the world laughed its head off. That Cook was speaking from the Mad Hatter Saloon merely added to the merriment.
City‚Äôs New York contingent now drink at a new and bigger location ‚Äî Amity Hall. And beyond its environs, nobody‚Äôs laughing. Certainly not the rivals who saw Manchester City as bumptious parvenus, and Cook‚Äôs boasts as the words of a fool.


Cook is long gone but he knew what City were about from the start. He knew who he worked for and he knew the ambition and resources behind the club. And while the competition underestimated City, Cook did not.
The club‚Äôs increasingly outspoken reaction to UEFA‚Äôs investigation over financial fair play is based on the belief that it is part of a campaign against them orchestrated by members of the Premier League elite, particularly Manchester United.
If so, it is a campaign that is working. A conveniently timed leak of UEFA‚Äôs intention to charge Manchester City, and ban them from Europe, reset the news agenda within 24 hours of their title win.


Having completed the first domestic treble win, Pep Guardiola was as good as asked in his press conference if he was a crook, receiving illegal payments.
And all because City‚Äôs owners didn‚Äôt turn out to be the mad hatters of popular imagination.
Nobody minded their oil money enriching the league when it was failing to entice Kaka to Manchester, or missing out on Champions League football courtesy of Harry Redknapp‚Äôs Tottenham and a Peter Crouch goal. That was Cook‚Äôs City; that was 2010.
At Wembley on Saturday we saw what that club became. A 116-year-old record matched; a landmark achieved; the standards of excellence being set, the bars that have been raised.


City haven‚Äôt got a defender as expensive as Virgil van Dijk, a midfielder as costly as Paul Pogba, even a striker in the range of what Arsenal paid for Alexandre Lacazette. So do not be fooled. Other clubs spend, too ‚Äî but perhaps not as wisely.
Guardiola is also a coaching visionary, getting extraordinary improvements from his players. That‚Äôs every bit as significant.
The protectionist FFP rules, meanwhile, have always been about keeping the established elite in place. Back in 2010, they thought they were untouchable, but that complacency has been exposed. Never forget the clubs who made football all about money in the first place.
What they really hate is City winning at their game.",MCFC

3216,759,759,Gabriel Jesus Isn't Good Enough For City,"I feel like I've heard this sentiment, or something very similar expressed A LOT this season. Perhaps you've heard it too. Maybe you've even held that opinion yourself. Maybe you've even given voice to it.

It's wrong.

Let me just start by acknowledging a couple key facts.

1. He's missed a lot of chances, but the one thing great strikers do better than anyone else, is get chances. Eventually they go in. He led the Premier League with an xG of 1.15. Miles better than anyone else with at least as many minutes as he had in the League.
2. He's always offsides.

You can have all of those arguments you want, because I'm still going to overwhelm that argument with the only one that really matters for a center forward: production. So here it is, a big, heaping plateful of it. Eat your heart out.

&amp;#x200B;

At age twenty-two he scored 21 goals with 6 assists, averaging a goal or an assist every 83.4 minutes. Compare that to Marcus Rashford's 13/9, and then consider that he registered all of those goals in 1,038 fewer minutes than Rashford. Last season Jesus had a combined 17 goals and 5 assists across all competitions (G/A: 117.9min).

&amp;#x200B;

As for the argument that he only racked up goals in lesser competitions against lesser sides, consider that 11 of those goals and 3 of those assists came in the Premier League and Champions League. That's a goal or an assist every 99.6 minutes. That's not as good as Sergio Aguero's 85.4 this season, but it is pretty much as good, or better, than all of the other best attacking players in the Premier League managed in the PL and Europe. (

* Salah: 108.4
* Mane: 133.8
* Firmino: 137.9
* Aubamayang: 94.1
* Lacazette 102.1
* Hazard: 102.75
* Kane: 115.3
* Son: 119.3

&amp;#x200B;

Now recall that he's at least three years younger than every name on that last, and at least four years younger than all but one (Kane).

&amp;#x200B;

Want comps from the continents (goals + assists per minute in all comps)? How about some of the other best young attackers in Europe like: 

* Timo Werner: 100.3
* Vincius: 108.5
* Luca Jovic: 97.1
* Joao Felix: 92.45

Again, Jesus' mark stands at one every 83.4 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

No, he isn't as good as Kylian Mbappe, who's goal+assist rate of 62.07 feels like a video game glitch, but no one else is. If you're disappointed by Jesus, it's probably not because of HIM, it's probably because you (like me) have been spoiled by watching Sergio Aguero for the past eight years, a man who's a master of turning half chances into goals. Jesus has a long way to go if he's ever to fill that legends boots, and in all likelihood, he never will (because how many people are Aguero?) but that doesn't mean he isn't good enough for us, and it doesn't mean he isn't one of the three or four best young center forwards in the world.",MCFC

However, with two starting-quality center backs leaving the team, I would think that signing a quality central defender would be priority? 

If Otamendi is to leave as expected, our depth at central defender would be:

Laporte
Stones
Mangala
Garcia
Sandler

Two proven starters, one Batmangala, and two unproven U-21 players. Garcia looked quality in preseason but that can only count for so much. Don‚Äôt know much about Sandler. I don‚Äôt know how much you can expect these two players to step up in a season.

* GK is sorted with Steffen joining
* RB if Danilo goes need someone who will be handy on either flank and won't mind the bench role. Kenny Lala of Strasbourg is a good shout. Don't think AWB will be a very good purchase as neither him nor Walker will be happy with the bench role. Someone with a hybrid RB/CB profile similar to Joe Gomez/Pavard might be handy.
*CB position needs to be filled in. If Ota is staying we need to go for De Ligt, if that's not working maybe Maguire (but will be very expensive). Ruben Dias being another option. I would also like Eric Garcia to be around and have a Fodenesque role. If ota is leaving I personally prefer some young bargain buy as a 4th CB.
*With Zin/Mendy/Laporte I guess we can atleast skip the need for a LB for one more season.

* DM is a must. I personally would like Rodri, if not NDombele. This should be our marquee signing. Whoever comes will be able to share the minutes with gundo and ferna.

* It seems at this point Gundo is gonna sign for a new contract. In that case I am happy with the CM options if Dave stays. KDB/Gundo for RCM spot which can be further reinforced by Bernardo whenever he is not playing in the flanks. LCM is for Gundo/Silva/Foden.

* If both Sane and Jesus stay we are good in the forward department. If one of them leaves we definitely need someone. I would like a wide forward profile Timo/Joao Felix as age might catch up Aguero at some point. Another wildcard option will be Sebastian Haller, who is valued around 35-40 mills.

*Another point is as Delph is almost certain to leave we need someone to fill the homegrown quota.

Part 2 of 2

And yet I choose to rebel against what an end wants to be. I choose to be grateful for the past but remain ambitious and driven for the future.
For the next 3 years, I will take up the role of Player-Manager of RSC Anderlecht. 
Belgium‚Äôs finest.  

This may come as a surprise to you. 
It‚Äôs the most passionate yet rational decision I‚Äôve ever made.

As a footballer, I was born and raised at RSC Anderlecht. 
Since the age of 6, I have been one with that club.
A history of 34 league titles, they are second to none.

The background to this story‚Ä¶
Belgian entrepreneur Marc Coucke acquired the club from the Vanden Stock family in December 2017.
What followed was a post take-over set back for a club that seemed robust but proved fragile. 
Although the take-over triggered a positive new vibe, sporting results did not follow.

I stopped at their training grounds on my way to international duty last year. Just to say hello.
Coucke, the chairman, and Sports Director Michael Verschueren asked my opinion regarding the difficult situation the club was in.
I shared my thoughts and listened to their vision for the future: ambitious, courageous and determined to get back to n¬∞1.
I offered my help, no strings attached, should they need it.

Later on in the season, newly appointed Technical Director Frank Arnesen joined and we organized some technical sessions on how to build a strong playing identity based on attractive, attacking football. 
RSCA has a tradition of having fantastic youth. 
You could say they have the past and the future, but struggle with the present.

Not so long ago, I took a call from RSC Anderlecht.
Quite unexpectedly, they offered me the position of Player-Manager. 
Michael and Frank explained to me in detail how they saw it working in practice. 
They had thought it through.
Mr. Coucke, the owner, pledged full support: time, budget, framework, staff, facilities ‚Ä¶ 
I was left not only impressed, but also intrigued by this sign of confidence in me. 
It got me thinking. 

The end of this season couldn‚Äôt be more memorable.
I have lived the dream here.  
I have learned so much the last 3 years.
From an incredible manager.
Pep Guardiola reignited my love for the game.
I‚Äôve witnessed, participated, analyzed, absorbed, studied.
Man City play the football I want to play.
It is the football I want to teach and to see played.

I have decided to take up the challenge at RSC Anderlecht.
Player-Manager. 
I want to share my knowledge with the next purple generations.
With that, I will also put a bit of Manchester in the heart of Belgium.

This is no goodbye. It‚Äôs a see you later. 
Et pour les Mauves, voor alle Anderlecht fans: tot binnenkort, √† tr√®s bient√¥t.

Love,

Vincent",MCFC

He frees up a CB spot, and that could keep Otamendi here, although they are no where near the same locker room presence. Or, if De Ligt is not going to Barca, and Otamendi still leaves, then De Ligt could be a good option, and maybe even our future captain. Kompany taking over a player-manager role could mean him gaining experience, and then re-joining us after Pep. This is not whatsoever a good deal now, but I think we could be even better down the line with this.",MCFC
3268,811,811,The Story of Vincent Kompany,"Vincent Kompany announces that he will leave after 11 years at the club. Our leader, when he first came he played in midfield. He was a decent player in midfield. Then dropped in deeper as a center back. As Former Manchester City Assistant Mark Bowen put it ""The two players were Pablo Zabaleta [who cost ¬£6.45m from Espanyol, made over 300 appearances and helped win three titles, as many League Cups and an FA Cup] and Vinny Kompany‚Äù. ‚ÄúStraight away you could see he was a leader, a fantastic professional. He was a man‚Äôs man and, although he was a Belgian who had arrived from Germany, he spoke fluent English,‚Äù added Bowen. ‚ÄúHe came across as a proper person, level-headed, someone who would immediately improve the club. Every time Manchester City needed someone to Step up, Vincent Kompany was the one. Our first title win in 44 years. A must win the game against Manchester United. He headed the only goal in that game for us to go and win on the last day of the season and the rest as they say his history. Our second premier league trophy in 2014. Vincent Kompany our captain was there again. Then the persistent injuries came. It's hurt everytime. Mentally it must have been exhausting for him. He came back everytime. He showed his true quality. Both on and off the pitch. Proper Centre half are a dying breed. Vincent Kompany represents the last of them. He perfectly combined strength and technique. Under Pep Guardiola, he's made an impact on the team in a different way less game time. However, every game he plays is a an 8/10 performance. The goal against Leicester City 45 yards away. Everyone in the stadium ""Don't Shot"". He for a second hesitate and then takes the shot on. The strike swerves into the top corner. He has a prominent place in Manchester City folklore.

Also sorry for the shameless plug I write for a page on Facebook known as Manchester City Fans Canada. I'm looking for other contributors for it.",MCFC

**Manchester City**

Key City midfielder Fernandinho has been sidelined since suffering a knee injury in the Manchester derby on April 24, and Guardiola said ""we'll see"" when asked if the Brazilian would be fit for the FA Cup Final.

Kevin De Bruyne is in contention after appearing as a late substitute at Brighton following a hamstring issue, while Claudio Bravo (Achilles) remains a long-term absentee.

Benjamin Mendy recently underwent further treatment in Barcelona as he continues to struggle with the after-effects of his latest knee injury.


**Watford**

Watford received good news on Monday as Jose Holebas saw his appeal against the red card received on the final day of the season against West Ham for a last-man foul on Michail Antonio upheld by the FA.

Player of the Season Etienne Capoue returned to the midfield on Sunday after recovering from a groin injury, with only Domingos Quina (shoulder) and Sebastian Prodl (knee) absent.

Welcome to the Puma era, and welcome to the first day of the new football season. Isn't it good to be back?

While Zinchenko has been off stalking journalists in California, Mendy has been off sitting on a surgeons table in Barcelona ~~and Pep has been signing contracts in Turin~~, the mod team have been sitting back, can of Carabao in hand, relaxing and recharging, reflecting on the season we've just had.

Inevitably reflecting turns to an itchy desire to inflict our ideals on the community we ~~dictate~~ oversee.

Gabriel Jesus has claimed the number 9 shirt this summer, and to celebrate we thought we would introduce a ninth subreddit rule to commemorate this occasion.

-----

##New Rule - Posts must be descriptive, factual and relevant

There has been a notable decline in the quality of posts and titles recently, and we are looking to nip this in the bud as silly season steps up a gear.

Going forward we will be taking a closer look at posts and titles and removing those that do not meet minimum standards.

###Goals and Other Videos

Eg. Gabriel Jesus scores a goal at the Copa America. You wish to post this to to /r/mcfc and revel in the moment with your fellow City fans. There are a few ways you could post this to the community, but some are better than others:

**A goal should be posted as a video**. Not a screenshot of a goal, not self post with your hot take, not a self post with a link to the video inside. Just post the video as a link, either by uploading to reddit, or by linking to the streamable or alternative provider.

The title is important as well. We will remove poorly thought out titles. **Jesus SCORES A GOAL** will get removed. **Gabriel Jesus goal (1-0 vs Argentina) Copa America** or similar will allow your post to remain, and you will soak up all that sweet sweet karma

###Transfer Rumours, Articles

Going forward all titles must have the source in brackets, where relevant, to start off, for example:

&gt; **[SOURCE] Information (not your opinion) and direct link to either the twitter/article source.**

eg. This is what we are looking for:

&gt; [Sam Lee] Mendy Ruled out for entire season with knee issue

We will be removing posts like this:

&gt; What do we all think of this?

All transfer self posts will be deleted (unless it pertains to an actual discussion of a player rather than a rumour. All transfer related posts will be removed unless presented in the correct format with it being a link + source in brackets.

All **click-bait titles will be removed**. This will help all users quickly see the relevant information at a glance. 

Obviously there will be some small exceptions, please remember to add relevant information to the title and present it as a link to the source, then all is good.

###Match Threads (+ Pre/Post)

It should be obvious which posts are Match Threads and (the same goes for Pre and Post Match Threads).

Fancy starting a pre match thread? Feel free! Add the opponent and the competition to the title, add **[Pre Match Thread]** to the start, add some info to the description about the opponent and lets get the discussion going! The mods will sticky your post and everyone is happy.

Match Threads can be started by the community or with MatchThreader or LiveCommentator. The links for both and how to summon them are in the sidebar. If you do start a match thread yourself, add **[Match Thread]** to the title, and make sure to mention the team we're playing.

Post Match threads gets abused the most, the karma race can lead to some poor titles. We want **[Post Match Thread]** to be at the start, and we want to opponent and score in the title. Anything low effort will be removed, and we will favour a better formatted post. A description is helpful and if you're feeling adventurous, add some goals or highlights to the description.

It is not the responsibility of the mods to post any of these threads, you can do it if you wish. The mods will try and post them if nothing has happened.

###Pictures

We love seeing your pictures of your experience at the ground, or relevant pictures. They should be described properly though. if your picture just says something like **Check This Out!** then we will remove it. If you describe what is in the picture a bit, then we have no reason to remove it and the community know what they're getting before they click on the title. **Just a single emoji as the title is unacceptable.**

If you're going to post a picture of a key moment in the game, have a think about whether it would be better served as a video. The recent example that springs to mind is Jesus's penalty goal in the Copa America, which was posted as a screenshot from before he kicked the ball and offered no value.

###Players Social Media

Sometimes a player does something on social media and you want to post it to our sub. That's great, content is king. Follow the same rules as above. If Mendy has gone on a bender, a sentence explaining what his video contains is valuable information. **Mendy polishes Pep's head with shoe polish** tells me everything I need to know, I'm already salivating at the thought of watching this video. Just calling the video **Lol Mendy absolute bantz** is absolutely useless and will lead to removal.

###Overall

The golden rule is to think about what you're contributing to the community, an extra 10 seconds thinking about your title helps others engage with your content much more easily.

If in doubt, ask.

##Updated Rule - Trolling or Brigading of Rival Subreddits

We have removed a rule referencing the messaging of mods as it was a bit vague and not really enforceable. This has been replaced by a new rule about the trolling or brigading of rival subreddits. This is something we have been enforcing for a while, but not sits as one of our key rules to make yourself familiar with.

It is a simple rule. Any users found to be causing trouble on a rival subreddit, and who are reported to us by that subreddit, will risk being banned from that subreddit as well /r/mcfc as a result. We also report trolls to other subreddits.

This does not affect /r/soccer. Do what you want over there.

-----

##Other Business

A quick reminder of the other 7 rules that we have, they're all visible on the side bar, the link is called **Subreddit rules**.

As before we be removing any comments which are aggressive in nature (Rule: Don't be a dick), and any spam (Rule: Don't spam). Posts that have nothing to do with City will also be removed (Rule: Stay on topic). We are a lenient bunch, so if your post is about the CFG or a wider topic relevant to the club, that is acceptable. Got a really cool bot that you want to show off which says hi to people when they say ""I'm""? That is an unhelpful bot (Rule: No unhelpful bots). That earns the bot a ban.

You are allowed to give the club stick here, and you can complain or point out things you don't like. You can even have a discussion about the moral dilemma you've had to wrestle with by supporting a club owned by someone who is from the Middle East. What you can't do is come in with an anti-city attitude (Rule: No City-bashing). Opinions are fine and respected. Deliberate attempts to cause drama result in a ban.

It would be great if you could post in the relevant thread (Rule: Post in the relevant thread where possible), or create one if you feel it is needed. If there is already a thread about the new Puma kit (there is), then that is the best place for it. New material can have it's own post, and if it is related but warrants it's own post that is fine (like a new video showing Mendy hurting his knee in the new Puma kit). 

Finally, rival fans are still not welcome here, any kind of spamming or non-constructive comment will result in bans, and we do actively report the users to their home team subreddit (Rule: Rival fans must contribute constructively). If you're a rival fan and you genuinely want to ask a question or have a discussion, that is fine, we are a nice bunch. If you want to brag about your team's wonderful defender or point out that the club is financed by slavery, then I'm afraid you'll have to take that elsewhere.

-----

## And Finally

If you see any violations of these rules, please report them to the mods and we will take a look as quickly as possible. If you think you've been unfairly banned or had your post removed, speak to us and we will help resolve the issue.

We hope that you find these rules beneficial going forward and that they help to make the experience on /r/mcfc more enjoyable. As always, feel free to give the mods feedback on these changes.",MCFC

Now that the season is well and truly over and the new season about to ramp up, I thought I'd take the time to review the players in the squad ahead of the new season. In order to do so, I have collated thousands of tweets, journalistic articles, opinion pieces and data points.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for the Premier League Champions scarves for every season city have won the league. Ideally 36/37, 67/68, 11/12, 13/14 (to be added to my 17/18 and 18/19 ones). Likely I will never find anything from 1937 or from 1968, so my main focus is on the 11/12 and 13/14 season.

Often times against bottom table sides, cup matches, and in short turnarounds between matches.

Otamendi - Stones - Laporte

Bernardo - De Bruyne - Rodri - Gundogan - San√©

First of all, I would love to see Gabriel Jesus and Ag√ºero playing a full 90 match together. I‚Äôm not sure if it has happened before, but it would be interesting to see how the team would fare with two deadly strikers up front. Second of all, having two people like Rodri and Gundogan would offer a lot of defensive security with a line-up like this considering that the team would have a three man back line.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I will be visiting for a week on September 21st and are trying to determine the best way to make it to the Watford match at the Etihad.  Unfortunately, it looks like we will be on a tight schedule with our plane arriving at London Heathrow @ 10:45am.

&amp;#x200B;

We are wondering if you guys had recommendations on the best ways to get up to the game (right now it says 15:00 (3pm) game time) in a timely fashion.  

* We see that we should have train options that may leave Heathrow at 11:18am and arrive at Manchester Piccadilly at 14:47 (2:27pm).  
   * Is this a reasonable option, are trains usually pretty on time in the area (on a weekend?).  In America that is almost never the case.  
   * We are traveling with backpacks only.  Are there any places to store a backpack during the game?
   * Last time I was in London the customs/immigration went pretty quickly (about 20 minutes) but who knows?

&amp;#x200B;

* We could rent a car and drive up which appears to be about the same time commitment but our concern is about parking around the stadium and whether it is reasonable or if there are tips to parking just far enough away for it to make sense. Again, we are traveling with backpacks only but having a car gives us a place to store our belonging during the game.

&amp;#x200B;

* This one is kind of a long shot, but our friends live in Warrington and we could take the train to Warrington to arrive at 14:14 (2:14pm) and then try to drive the rest of the way (which would save us from having to rent a car and also give us a place to stash out backpacks)

&amp;#x200B;

We also have an option to try to get Everton tickets on the following weekend.  Is that a more reasonable request or should we focus our energy on getting to the Etihad?

&gt; https://fantasy.premierleague.com

Second thing is to have a look around the site. They‚Äôve got explanations of how to sign up and how the game is played. No point in me explaining it here because I‚Äôll just be repeating what they say. It‚Äôs easy to follow. Millions of people play every season. 

Once you‚Äôre signed up you‚Äôll want to join our league. *Best league in the land and all the world!* To do that, you‚Äôll need a code. Our code this season is:

&gt; aeenuv

Once you‚Äôre joined in the league head back to the sub and brag **in this thread** about how awesome your team is. Mines already mint. I‚Äôve got de Bruyne because he‚Äôs gonna boss it this season. There‚Äôs no rules on who you have in your team. If you want mid-table mediocrity to save a few mil then, sure, go for Pogba. Your mistakes are your mistakes. 

Just so we‚Äôre clear, this is for fun. There‚Äôs no fee to enter, it‚Äôs all free, and there are no prizes for winning. You‚Äôll just win the knowledge that you‚Äôre basically the FPL version of Guardiola. Anyone finishing at the bottom, sorry, you‚Äôre basically Tony Pulis. 

Remember it‚Äôs just a laugh so don‚Äôt take it too seriously and don‚Äôt take 6 weeks to pick your team because you might just miss out. **I will be closing entry to the league the day the season starts ie 09/08/19.** You have been warned.

In midfield we've got KDB, Silva, Bilva, Gundogan, Fernandinho, Rodri (new). Nobody seems nailed on in the midfield.

In the back 4, Walker has to fight Cancelo (if he comes, seems unlikely, but who knows).

If we sign Maguire than Stones will have to challenge him and Otamendi will fall on the 4th position.

If Mendy is fit, it will become Mendy vs Zinchenko for that spot.

3550,1093,1093,The new long term captain,"I've been thinking a lot about this since David Silva's announcement. Regrettably, I don't think Aguero and Fernandinho will be around for another 2 seasons. These are the three senior players I'd expect to be captain after Kompany however their short term solutions. That leaves the question of who?  They would need to be almost certain starters and have a big presence in the squad. Below are my reasons for and against 3 players that could be in contention. Comment below your thoughts  


**Kevin De Bruyne**

Loved by fans, time and time again Kevin has shown how important he is on the field. To many, he would be the ideal choice. For starters, he's a big game player, scoring winning goals against PSG, United, Chelsea for example. However, I can't help think back to one moment in 2017. Kevin 'loses his cool' at the end of a game against Napoli. Shouting ""Let me talk"" towards David Silva and Fernandinho. He's not afraid to show his emotions, reportedly being furious at Pep for subbing him off against Burton in January 2019. Was this just passion or could his frustrations land him in trouble while dealing with refs every game?

&amp;#x200B;

**Raheem Sterling**

Raheem's career seemed to have stagnated while under Manuel Pellegrini. Luckily for us, Pep Guardiola and influence from Mikel Arteta turned the player from 11 goals and 10 assists in 47 appearances to 25 goals and 18 assists in 51 appearances. But, numbers don't make a captain. In the last few months, he has shown great maturity off the pitch, Donating a large amount towards those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire and accusing the British media of fueling racism. However, do you think Raheem shows this level of maturity on the field? Well, he was given England captaincy for his 50th appearance. Gareth Southgate must see some leadership quality there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Aymeric Laporte**

Laporte played in 35/38 Premier League games last season. A rock at the back he never seems to complain and gets on with the job. A quality you would want from every player. At the moment he a certain starter above all the other centre backs at the club. Does his command at the back make the power defender capable to be the captain or is it too soon to tell in his early City career?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. I'm sure there are a lot more points for and against each of these players that ive not even touched on. Personally, for me it's between Kevin and Raheem however I feel both lack maturity on the field at the moment which can change in the next year in time for Davids departure Maybe could it even be someone else? John Stones? Bernardo Silva? or even Delph???",MCFC

I get Maguire is good and he's experienced and all that jazz. But is it really justified to spend 80m on him? No offence to whoever likes him, but he's really not worth more than 50m. We could easily promote Garcia or Sandler and give them the 4th choice spot, with Fernandinho stepping in when necessary. Dinho was great as a CB when he's been deployed there last season, he has the intelligence as well as the experience and physicality to excel there.

Also, there are a lot more defenders currently, who imo are as good, if not better than Maguire. Skriniar is one. Koulibaly is out of the picture for now sadly, though spending this much on him would be justified. Alderweireld is another really worth candidate. 

We could get Alderweireld for a measly sum who would give us enough backup for a good season which would give Stones and Laporte some more time to cement that partnership. It would also give us time to look at other better options in a year.

The crazy rumors of him going to Juve that so many so called ‚ÄúTier 1‚Äù italian journalists got wrong is probably him or Juve laying the groundwork and planting the seed for his eventual arrival, the same way Pep was rumored heavily in Pelligrini‚Äôs last season.

The arrival of Sarri to implement a similar style of play to Pep‚Äôs and to ease the transition from Allegri‚Äôs more rigid style, the same way Pelligrini was seen as a good transition to Pep from Mancini.

The future squad planning. This ones a bit of a reach but Pep was heavily rumored to have chosen Sterling, KDB and Sane while still being Bayern manager. The acquisition of De Ligt could be seen in a similar light and maybe could‚Äôve been the deciding factor for him to join Juve ahead of Barca and co.

Now I couldn‚Äôt care less where Pep goes after he leaves us, he‚Äôs been absolutely brilliant for us and has took us to new heights I doubt we‚Äôll see again in my lifetime, but if it does turn out that he‚Äôs planning for Juve while still being with us would that sour anyone‚Äôs opinion of him?",MCFC

- Rodrigo **(should be done)**

- Maguire/ De Ligt/ Unknown (Otamendi Leaving Caveat)

- Cancelo (Danilo Leaving Caveat)

Thats all the business I see City doing this window to be honest. I think Sane and Gundogan will stay. 

-------------------------

##  [](#icon-notes-big) **On to some history of Manchester Citys ruining football!**

lets take a look at our spend/net spend whatever you want to call it over the last 11 seasons of Sheik Mansour being in charge. I wont be counting this season coming as that would include THIS summer + the winter window. 


|Season|Expenditure|Income|Net|
:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Season 18/19|¬£69,750,000|¬£69,800,000|¬£50,000|

|Season 08/09|¬£127,700,000|¬£14,800,000|-¬£112,900,000|
|||||
|||||
|Totals|¬£1,391,050,000|¬£434,850,000|-¬£956,200,000|


An average net spend of ¬£88m over the last 11 seasons. I personally HATE net spend. Its for stupid people to use when in reality it ignores so many other pieces of how tranfers are worked on the books. In reality transfers account for a few things:

1) Length of contract

2) Transfer fee

3) Wages

4) Contract Expiry/Transfer Income when said player leaves

Thats how a transfer should be calculated. Looking at transfer at facevalue can be quite silly. To give an example of David Silva who lets say for this argument has been on ¬£200k a week for the entire time he has been here. With a fee off ¬£25m + 9 years at the club + 1 more. David Silva would have served 10 years. Thus his transfer fee on the actual books per accounting terms is 25/10 = a measly ¬£2.5m per year due to amortisation. With 200k a week at ¬£9.6m per year wages David Silva costs Manchester City on the books at ¬£9.6m + ¬£2.5m =¬£12.1m per year. This is one of the reasons City like to extend contracts early in their life so they can further spread the transfer fee over the life of the contract. So in reality the transfer fee of ¬£2.5m per year starts of bigger and gets smaller of time. Its probably closer to ¬£1-2m depending on when his extensions were signed. Gundogan for example who only has 1 year left on his contract per transfer fee amortisation we would have mostly paid off his transfer fee on the books and are almost only at wages. 

Hope thats not confusing!

----------------------

Alas back into our transfer books

The first 3 seasons of our spending in the Mansour era basically went unaccounted for. The owner was basically dumping money into the club left right and centre. A big chunk of our initial spend lies there with us spending a whopping **¬£483,450,000** in those first 3 seasons. This is what I call the ""catch up"" phase. There is no doubt in my mind that Manchester City squad was wayyy behind the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, and Arsenal. So we essentially had to spend a lot to catch up if we wanted to compete with the big clubs. This is the only time you could actually say City were ""ruining football"" and thats purely because the fees at the time were high and we had to spend over the odds to go quick. Though by the 11/12 season we had AGUERRROOOOOd our first PL title.  So fuck it!

## [](#icon-news-big) **FFP implications** 

Manchester City first started to get implications of potential FFP implications around 2011 to 2013 with an eventual fine and squad limitation in 2014. These same issues are cropping up again from the same time period - our books are good in the present but we might again get punished for wrong doings in 2014 (Can I get a fuck UEFA?). This is why in the seasons between 11/12 to 14/15 season we only had a net spend of ¬£180m over 4 years. This is what Khaldoon described as a pinch that effectively slowed City down because they had to get legitimate streams of revenue to do any further club improvement as per the rules City were no longer allowed to get money from Mansour direclty anymore. 

So we effectively have had to do 2 catch up periods due to FFP. We caught up in 11/12 then stagnated back down. Although we won the PL in 2014 just take a look at the 3 seasons afterwards where we only 1 trophy during that period (league cup in 2016, can i get a fuck Liverpool?) as our squad was aging/not good enough. 


##  [](#icon-notes-big) **New TV money + commercial revenue hugely increased**


After that period we finally were able to freely spend again and with the coming of Pep Guardiola it was time to invest wisely in the squad and get back to the top. In the last 4 seasons we have spent a massive **¬£662,900,000** or a netspend of **¬£426,250,000**. A lot of opposing fans will tell you that we must be cheating or the owner is dropping money to do this. 

A netspend of ¬£426,250,000 over 4 years is really not that much with the amount of revenue that comes in. The good thing about City is that the owners DO NOT take money out of the club at all. Every ounce it makes stays within the club. We also have 0 debt. In comparison take a look at what [Uniteds](https://i.redd.it/b4hxwon8ud531.jpg) owners are doing and yet are still able to have a netspend of around ¬£300m in the same time period. 

## [](#icon-notes-big) **Looking at Individual Players** 

I have seen a lot of opposing fans like to claim that Citys buys have always been poor and they just go out and spend another 100m to fix the issue. 

Till this day our record Transfer fee is Riyad Mahrez at ¬£60m 

In the Mansour era we have probably bought around 70-100 players into the first team and obviously most have left or been sold in that time frame. We have also bought a lot of youth who we are starting to see fees coming back from. 

### The bad and TBDs Over the last 11 years 

Suprisingly we havent done too many blunders in our years of spending. You can never nail every transfers for sure but I was acutally suprised how few we have got wrong since the takeover. 

|Players|Buy Fee|Rating|Sold Fee|Money Lost|Season @ City|On Loan|Fee Spread|
:--|--:|:--|--:|--:|:--|:--|--:|
|Benjamin Mendy|¬£52,000,000|TBD||TBA|2|0|¬£26,000,000|
|Eliaquim Mangala|¬£32,000,000|Bad|¬£5,000,000|-¬£27,000,000|5|2|¬£6,400,000|

|Stevan Jovetic|¬£25,800,000|Bad|¬£14,750,000|-¬£11,050,000|4|2|¬£2,762,500|
|Emmanuel Adebayor|¬£25,000,000|Bad|¬£5,000,000|-¬£20,000,000|4|3|¬£5,000,000|
|Jo|¬£18,000,000|Bad|¬£0|-¬£18,000,000|3|2|¬£6,000,000|
|Roque Santa Cruz|¬£17,500,000|Bad|¬£1,000,000|-¬£16,500,000|5|3|¬£3,300,000|
|Claudio Bravo|¬£17,100,000|Bad||TBA|3|0|¬£5,700,000|
|Javi Garcia|¬£16,000,000|Bad|¬£13,000,000|-¬£3,000,000|2|0|¬£1,500,000|
|Jack Rodwell|¬£15,000,000|Bad|¬£10,000,000|-¬£5,000,000|2|1|¬£2,500,000|
|Nolito|¬£13,800,000|Bad|¬£7,900,000|-¬£5,900,000|1|0|¬£5,900,000|
|Patrick Roberts|¬£11,000,000|Bad||TBA|4|4|¬£2,750,000|
|Scott Sinclair|¬£8,000,000|Bad|¬£3,500,000|-¬£4,500,000|3|2|¬£1,500,000|
|Totals|¬£311,700,000||¬£94,150,000|¬£137,450,000|||¬£79,895,833|


So over 11 years of transfers we have essentially lost ¬£137m to bad transfers. With a lot of those contracts majority spending it out on loan so on the books we probably werent paying their wages but only the bad transfer fee.  (I made up the mangala sell fee of ¬£5m because having that not count here is really bad lol)

The fee spread is a good way to visualise how much it roughly cost us per season on the books. 


Nothings hits me more than when opposing fans say we just buy any and every play at 40-50m and if they dont work we just buy another. Looking at this we have only had a few poor transfers in the last few seasons. Everything else was almost 5 seasons ago.

----------------------------------

## [](#icon-ball)[](#icon-net) **Some stats:**


- In the 11 years since the take over Manchester City have spent  ¬£30m or more a total of only 15 times

- Over ¬£40m a total of 8 times

- Over ¬£50m a total of 4 times

- Over ¬£60m a **grand total of 0 fucken times**

- Of players at or over ¬£30m they have been demed good transfers 13 out of 15 times. Take out Mendy and itll go down to 12 out of 15 times. Thats a success rate of 87% -  pretty good if you ask me. 


With this youll see the club is in immaculately healthy position players and fee wise. 


So when opposing fans tell you Manchester City are ruining football. Tell them kindly to fuck off lol. 

Final note: Rodriguez is about to ruin my over ¬£60m transfer fee due to his ‚Ç¨70m release clause which due to current conversion rates becomes ¬£62.1m (BOOOOO!!!) - Fuck it though he is going to be amazing and is only 22 years old. 5 years in when he is hitting his peak that fee will look tiny when Clubs will be paying ¬£100m for Delph like players.",MCFC

3669,1212,1212,Rodri stats compared to Fernandinho and Busquets,"Since yesterday I am hyped for Rodri and can't wait for him to sign for us. I was checking how well he would be suited to City and his stats say it all. I compared his 18/19 season with 17/18 Fernandinho and 15/16 Busquets. I believe 17/18 and 15/16 were the best seasons for Ferna and Busquets respectively. This is what I found

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Stat|Rodri (18/19)|Fernandinho(17/18)|Busquets(15/16)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|*Minutes*| 2743 | 2885 | **2906** |
|*Tackles per game*| **3** |1.8|2.9|
| *Fouls per game* |1.7|1.2| **0.9** |
| *Interceptions per game* |1.2|1.4| **1.9** |
| *Clearances per game* | **2** |1.9|0.7|
| *Dribbled past per game* | **1.1** |1.2| **1.1** |
| *Block Per Game* | **0.3** |0.2|0.1|
| *Key passes per game* |0.5| **0.6** | 0.5|
| *Dribbles per game* | **0.6** | **0.6** |0.3|
| *Dispossessed per game* |0.9| **0.6** |0.7|
| *Bad control per game* |0.6|1| **0.4** |
| *Passes per game* |56.7| **87.5** |69.2|
| *Pass success percentage* | **91.1** |90.1|89.8|
|Avg Rating (Whoscored)|7.24| **7.44** |7.28|

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From the above stats it is pretty evident that Rodri is defensively almost par with prime Fernandinho and Busquets whereas has scope for improvement offensively. Being 22 and with Pep as his coach, I am pretty confident he can only improve and will become one of the best DMs to have ever played. 

&amp;#x200B;

The standout stat for me is Bad control per game. I thought Fernandinho almost never had a bad touch and Rodri's stat is better than Ferna.",MCFC

Sounding optimistic we could have at least one in next week.

I would expect it to be Rodri.

Don't count out de Ligt just yet. The player has asked again about Pep and City.

There are hurdles (some are more obvious than others)

He's feeling the pressure a little in terms of all the interest. Worryingly, Liverpool have also started some sort of charm offensive.

Maguire is considered at least ¬£20m too expensive and doesn't represent the value we want from making City's next centre half the most expensive in the world.

Mino certainly has food for thought.

If Leroy goes, Felix comes. Zinchenko and Walker new deals to be announced when they return.

Muric wanted on loan by two Premier League clubs.

Don't think Otamendi is leaving as things stand, maybe Vinny going has changed that.

No real update on Leroy. Bravo staying for final year.

What those terms and conditions are, we may never know. What we do know is this is exactly how it happened when Pep joined City from Bayern. Pep had already starting advising City on potential targets as early as a year before he joined. Starling the most famous one. 

Also, most people don‚Äôt remember this, but Bayern fans were shocked and left bitter Pep was leaving. Some players even admitted they were caught unaware. Especially after culling a CL /WC winning squad and never delivering the CL himself. Regardless of the trophies he brings in the coming 2 years, I doubt Pep will want to repeat anything like that again. When he says he is here for another 2 years, I believe him.

The main points is:

1) City's owner is actually an investor who invests in lot of things (examples are given in the thread), including football. Hence this is an investment not a PR exercise. This is also supported by numbers that city is profittable lsat 4 years. The club value is estimated at 2.2 bn while he says the investment (total) is around 1.3 bn. Personally the investment amount seems a little less imo.

&amp;#x200B;

Kun Notes:

\- It's Kun...there's not a lot that you guys aren't well aware of.

\- Insanely consistent bagging 33, 30, then 32 goals. Minute totals of 3500, 2900, and 3400.

\- The threat of GJ was exactly what he needed.

\- Personal opinion for next season is that he plays slightly less minutes and hopefully puts up 34-40 goals as we start bedding in GJ. He could easily get 40+ rotation is obviously key.

&amp;#x200B;

Gabriel Jesus Notes:

\- Embracing the role of deputy with great morale which had to be difficult considering he was first choice not long after coming in on fire and especially with those two injuries.

\- Has a lot of work to do timing his runs and will get better as a finisher. We're blessed with Kun so I think that diminishes Gabby to a degree. The fact of the matter is that he scores goals when he plays and the squad doesn't significantly drop off either.

\- Constantly coming in as a SUB and without a long run of starts weakens his numbers but as a number 2 and potential long term replacement he's been perfect for us these past 2 and a half seasons and I'm not sure that we win two league cups and the FA without him.

\- There's been chatter over the years about fans not being sure if he can lead the line with Kun out and I'm 100% convinced that's bogus. There's also been chatter about not trust him for the big games and that also is 100% bogus. I ran the PL data on games he started / played over 45 minutes and it came back with a 30-4-1 record which is on pace for 102 points. I also ran though those games looking for matches vs top teams and he's excelled every time he's been given the chance. He's started Spurs away, Chelsea away, and vs LFC. We won all 3, he scored 3 and assisted 1. Obviously there was the cup final where he scored 2 and assisted 1 as well.

\- He's not ready yet but I hope he gets more chances in bigger games.

\- Personal Opinion for next season is that he gets close to 2800 minutes and threatens 30 goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Kelechi Notes:

\- Super bummed that it's not working out for him because he always seemed to get the job done when he was called upon. Obviously he had to leave but thanks Kelechi for missing that easy goal vs us!",MCFC

Both Premier League clubs will have scouts watching Benfica teenager Felix in Portugal‚Äôs Nations League semi-final against Switzerland in Porto on Wednesday night.

United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has targeted Portugal‚Äôs latest footballing sensation as he begins the rebuilding of his team after a disappointing season.

But he faces fierce competition from Real, who are desperate to land the Benfica teenager, City and also Italian giants Juventus.

Benfica want around ¬£120million and Real have already seen an opening bid of around ¬£80m rejected.

But they are now expected to use Benfica‚Äôs interest in goalkeeper Keylor Navas to try to clinch a deal next week after the finals.

Felix, 19, scored 18 goals in 33 games for Benfica this season and became the youngest player to score a Europa League hat trick since Sergio Aguero when he netted three against Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter finals in April.

The teenager is set to make his senior debut for Portugal against the Swiss in Porto, after being called up for the finals by coach Fernando Santos

3904,1447,1447,Mendy needs to be replaced or scared into reality,"Benjamin Mendy has only made 17 league appearances in his 2 years on the blue side of Manchester compared to his 1 year in ligue 1 with monoco where he made 8 more appearances with 25. In my opinion he is a liability and Pep Guardiola should highly consider out right replacing him or buying another left-back to put some fear in mendy. I could easily make the argument that with a healthy mendy the title race would've been a lot smoother and maybe we would be talking about champions league glory with that bum rushing, good crossing, and powerful option at left-back. Instead we had an out of position zinchenko at left-back which I must say he did a job but he wasn't mindblowing. It has been said Guardiola will be giving him another chance which I could get behind as long as we go out and buy someone to give him a run for his money. I would be very happy with buying a chilwell or a Tierney from Celtic this would get Mendy off of the social media and focusing on his fitness and his place in the squad. Also we must say the Premier league is a way more physical league then the French league he has already shown to be injury prone so we must get another recruit for that side of the back line. Just to finish this off I should let you know I am a fan of mendy and his abilities he obviously is a world class left back but if we want to continue our dominance in England and progressing in Europe I believe this is a problem position based on Benjamin's attitude and fitness. Anyone agree?",MCFC

3935,1478,1478,Man City identify three midfield summer transfer targets,"Source : Sky Sports


Manchester City are monitoring three midfielders as they continue their pursuit of a replacement for Fernandinho.

According to Manchester evening news,¬†Atletico Madrid midfielder¬†Rodri¬†remains City's No.1 target but the Blues are not pinning all of their hopes on landing the 22-year-old.

Rodri has a release clause of ‚Ç¨70million at Atletico but City are hopeful of signing him for a lower fee.

Should that not be possible City may look elsewhere, with Lyon's¬†Tanguy Ndombele¬†and Real Madrid's¬†Marco Llorente¬†both on the Blues' radar.
Ndombele shone for Lyon in their Champions League win at the Etihad at the beginning of the campaign.

Lyon reportedly rejected a bid from Tottenham for the 22-year-old midfielder earlier this week.

Llorente, meanwhile, endured an injury-ravaged campaign at Madrid and managed just 16 appearances in all competitions.

City are determined to sign Fernandinho's long-term successor this summer after losing out to Chelsea in their pursuit of Jorginho last year.
It had looked for all the world like the Italy international would move to the Etihad only for the lure of moving to London and working with Maurizio Sarri to turn his head at the 11th hour.

Fernandinho turns 35 next season and injury forced him to miss almost a quarter of City's Premier League games over the course of their title-winning campaign.

The Germany international Ilkay Gundogan proved himself to be an able deputy for Fernandinho in the run-in but there are doubts surrounding his long-term future at the club, despite his insistence that he is keen to renew his contract in Manchester.",MCFC

Manchester United are reportedly looking to beat rivals City to the signature of Sporting Lisbon midfielder¬†Bruno Fernandes.

The 24-year-old scored 32 goals and contributed 18 assists in 53 matches last season and as a result has attracted interest from European clubs.

United are eyeing a move for Fernandes and are set to challenge Premier League champions City, according to Portuguese outlet A Bola.

The newspaper's front page on Friday, translated in English, read: 'Man United come ahead.

'Proposal of City does not convince and rival of Manchester will attack Bruno Fernandes.'

United are reportedly able to outbid their city rivals - City can offer ¬£49million (‚Ç¨55million) while United can give up to ¬£71m (‚Ç¨80m).",MCFC

I am curious what everyone thinks the squad needs to improve on from an individual standpoint.  I have a couple of initial thoughts:

In general - defending corners and set pieces which has been poor for a couple of seasons now

Jesus - staying onsides and lower body strength/balance so he doesn't get pushed off the ball so easily

Mahrez - shot accuracy, too many balls 10 rows into the stands

Walker - better accuracy and timeliness with his crosses &amp; staying calm in high pressure situations

Sane - his attitude and work rate seems like they can be greatly improved

Mendy - staying healthy?",MCFC

Some may be worried their will be some sort of drop off, maybe a lack of leadership in the locker room in the coming season due to Kompany‚Äôs departure. I would like to remind you  Carles Puyol retired at the end of the 2013/14 season and Barcelona went on to win the Treble the following 2014/15 season, without Puyol.  It‚Äôs going to be a great opportunity for players like Sterling and De Bruyne to grow into bigger leadership roles like those in the Barcelona squad had to do without their long-time captain.

As you probably know we‚Äòve been heavily linked with San√©. I have been following him since his early Schalke days and I would love it if we signed him. I was pretty bummed out when we missed out on him.

Now to my question: you hear all kinds of different sources saying different things. Some say his relationship with Pep is not good and some say they get along fine. Some say he wants to return to Germany and some say he wants to have another go at City.

I think you guys know the most, since you‚Äòre the fans of the club lol. So, what is San√©‚Äôs situation at City? Is there a possibility that he signs for Bayern in this transfer window? I know he won‚Äôt be cheap (¬£80m at the lowest but probably more like ¬£100m) but I think we might be okay with paying that much for a German player with that kind of quality and ceiling.

Appreciate all the answers and good luck in the next season!",MCFC
4084,1627,1627,[OC] Are Manchester City the team of the decade?,"Domestically I think we've taken the crown for the team of the decade!

|Team|Points|
:--|--:|
|Manchester City|15.0|
|Chelsea|14.5|
|Manchester United|7.5|
|Arsenal|4.5|
|Liverpool|1.0|
|Spurs|0|

-------------------
the next logical thing to look at is consistency, and to do that we look at table finishes

Manchester city lead this by a staggering point and a bit. With an average finish of 2.3. 

|Year|Man City|Chelsea|Man United|Arsenal|Tottenham|Liverpool|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|2010|5|1|2|3|4|7|
|2011|3|2|1|4|5|6|
|2012|1|6|2|3|4|8|
|2013|2|3|1|4|5|7|
|2014|1|3|7|4|6|2|
|2015|2|1|4|3|5|6|
|2016|4|10|5|2|3|8|
|2017|3|1|6|5|2|4|
|2018|1|5|2|6|3|4|
|2019|1|3|6|5|4|2|
|Average|2.3|3.5|3.6|3.9|4.1|5.4|

We smash this out of the park! With my made up number system I'll give 6 points to City and count downwards from there to an updated table of:

|Team|Points|
:--|--:|
|Manchester City|21|
|Chelsea|19.5|
|Manchester United|11.5|
|Arsenal|7.5|
|Liverpool|2|
|Spurs|2|



The next thing I want to look at is top 4 finishes and top 6 finishes. To me if you aren't 1st, then 2nd, 3rd and 4th are pretty much equal as you all make the CL and win nothing. 5th and 6th generally means EL. On this system I'm doing a minus system of no CL =-0.2 

|Team|Points|
:--|--:|
|Manchester City|20.8|
|Chelsea|18.9|
|Manchester United|10.9|
|Arsenal|6.9|
|Spurs|1|
|Liverpool|0.8|



----------


One thing I haven't counted in this calculation is winning the EL I did factor this in for getting CL the next year (example United) but not sure what value to give the trophy? Maybe 1.5?

If so then next week there is the huge implication of Chelsea finishing above us for the team of the decade! And whoever loses the CL final finishes last  on my made up top 6 ladder. 

Hope you enjoyed let me know if I should add or remove anything, or something I've missed!

----------------------------- 

## **From a City point of view** 

------------------------ 

## [](#icon-star-big) Tier Gospel 

- [Man City official](https://twitter.com/ManCity) - The only one that really counts. 

## [](#icon-news-big) **Tier One** 

- [\[Sam Lee\]](https://twitter.com/Sammy_Goal) - Goal - General rule with Sam anything he puts in a tweet or in a reply dont treat it as Tier 1 news, treat it as 2-3+. Anything he prints in an article treat it as Tier 1 news. He has said this multiple times in other Tweets and on Podcasts. The same thing in podcasts hell say something but dont treat it as Tier 1, for example in the last 93:20 podcast he said he has heard rumors about Harry Kane being a City target and an Aguero replacement but wont print it because he just doesn't see it happening but the sources he has heard it off are quite reliable. /u/sammy_goal - he is also are local resident here. 

- [\[Martin Blackburn\]](https://twitter.com/SunMartinB) - The Sun (unfortunately) - Does not print much transfer news but is usually nailed on when he prints something. Youll notice his last tweet is him saying Pep will sign a 2 year extension back in 2017 keeping him for 5 years! 

- [\[Simon Mullock\]](https://twitter.com/MullockSMirror) - The Mirror - The same With Martin, doenst print much but when he does he generally is pretty close and nailed on and has a long history with the club, his articles generally get down-voted to oblivion on /r/soccer due to him from The Mirror which is generally tier 10.  similar to Martin as its The Sun. 

With Tier ones ive seen plenty of people say oh but they said we were in for this and that didnt happen so they are not reliable. 

Youll never see Sam, Martin or Simon ever say, this is ""done"" to City.  Youll see them say the club is interested or strongly believe they land their target. You need to always remember they are talking from the clubs perspective and how they feel as their sources are generally City sources. 

## [](#icon-news-big) **Tier Two** 

- [[Simon Stone (BBC)]](https://twitter.com/sistoney67) - More of a United reporter to be fair but he does get some news on City and is pretty reliable for us especially considering he is from the BBC. The guys above will usually report first and then Simon will afterwards 

- [[Duncan Castles]](https://twitter.com/DuncanCastles)- also more of a united supporter and an anti city one at that. He falls for me between tier 2 and 3. However we can‚Äôt ignore the strong sources he has and he especially has a strong link with Super agent Mendes who represents a lot of city players. 



## [](#icon-news-big) **Tier 3** 

- [\[Jose Alvarez Haya\]](https://twitter.com/10JoseAlvarez) - Spanish Correspondent to Man City - Jose was tier 2 last year, he's been dropped to tier 3. Was great with line up leaks which have stopped as the club put an end to it. Any news he leaks ajohr Aguero though treat it as tier one. He basically gets it from Aguero directly that's definitely been clear over the last 2 years 


**ITKS**

Some ITKs are much more reliable than others but ill bundle them all together as tier 3s ITKS to me are always the funnest because its always from a whisper of news and theres generally something to it but as they are not journalists so they really dont have a reliability and reputation to keep up so as always with ITK's take them with a grain of salt or go crazy over them. 

- [MCFCJustSaying](https://twitter.com/MCFCjustsayin) - twitter ITK

- Tolmie - Bluemoon - ITK

- Ric - BlueMoon Admin

- [BillyShears/Ahsan](https://twitter.com/9320pod) (93:20 pod) 

- MCRJON - BM ITK - Godlike accuracy but hasn't posted since he said Kyle Walker is done in May 2017 (he signed in July...) and seeing Bernardo walk right past him at the CFA...

## **Not from a City point of view**
-------------------------- 

For other clubs or OUTSIDE sources, example an Italian newspaper talking about a City target from an Italian club look at this as a [guide](https://np.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/bogkgn/transfer_rumour_reliability_guide_summer_2019/). Thanks to /u/spoofex.  If you see a spanish paper talking about a target in Germany going to City its usually bullshit. However a reliable Barcelona paper with ties to Txiki/Pep may have knowledge from anywhere so its always good to know that on a scale of reliability as well.

‚ÄòThe biggest and best football club in the world,‚Äô he predicted. And the world laughed its head off. That Cook was speaking from the Mad Hatter Saloon merely added to the merriment.
City‚Äôs New York contingent now drink at a new and bigger location ‚Äî Amity Hall. And beyond its environs, nobody‚Äôs laughing. Certainly not the rivals who saw Manchester City as bumptious parvenus, and Cook‚Äôs boasts as the words of a fool.


Cook is long gone but he knew what City were about from the start. He knew who he worked for and he knew the ambition and resources behind the club. And while the competition underestimated City, Cook did not.
The club‚Äôs increasingly outspoken reaction to UEFA‚Äôs investigation over financial fair play is based on the belief that it is part of a campaign against them orchestrated by members of the Premier League elite, particularly Manchester United.
If so, it is a campaign that is working. A conveniently timed leak of UEFA‚Äôs intention to charge Manchester City, and ban them from Europe, reset the news agenda within 24 hours of their title win.


Having completed the first domestic treble win, Pep Guardiola was as good as asked in his press conference if he was a crook, receiving illegal payments.
And all because City‚Äôs owners didn‚Äôt turn out to be the mad hatters of popular imagination.
Nobody minded their oil money enriching the league when it was failing to entice Kaka to Manchester, or missing out on Champions League football courtesy of Harry Redknapp‚Äôs Tottenham and a Peter Crouch goal. That was Cook‚Äôs City; that was 2010.
At Wembley on Saturday we saw what that club became. A 116-year-old record matched; a landmark achieved; the standards of excellence being set, the bars that have been raised.


City haven‚Äôt got a defender as expensive as Virgil van Dijk, a midfielder as costly as Paul Pogba, even a striker in the range of what Arsenal paid for Alexandre Lacazette. So do not be fooled. Other clubs spend, too ‚Äî but perhaps not as wisely.
Guardiola is also a coaching visionary, getting extraordinary improvements from his players. That‚Äôs every bit as significant.
The protectionist FFP rules, meanwhile, have always been about keeping the established elite in place. Back in 2010, they thought they were untouchable, but that complacency has been exposed. Never forget the clubs who made football all about money in the first place.
What they really hate is City winning at their game.",MCFC

4136,1679,1679,Gabriel Jesus Isn't Good Enough For City,"I feel like I've heard this sentiment, or something very similar expressed A LOT this season. Perhaps you've heard it too. Maybe you've even held that opinion yourself. Maybe you've even given voice to it.

It's wrong.

Let me just start by acknowledging a couple key facts.

1. He's missed a lot of chances, but the one thing great strikers do better than anyone else, is get chances. Eventually they go in. He led the Premier League with an xG of 1.15. Miles better than anyone else with at least as many minutes as he had in the League.
2. He's always offsides.

You can have all of those arguments you want, because I'm still going to overwhelm that argument with the only one that really matters for a center forward: production. So here it is, a big, heaping plateful of it. Eat your heart out.

&amp;#x200B;

At age twenty-two he scored 21 goals with 6 assists, averaging a goal or an assist every 83.4 minutes. Compare that to Marcus Rashford's 13/9, and then consider that he registered all of those goals in 1,038 fewer minutes than Rashford. Last season Jesus had a combined 17 goals and 5 assists across all competitions (G/A: 117.9min).

&amp;#x200B;

As for the argument that he only racked up goals in lesser competitions against lesser sides, consider that 11 of those goals and 3 of those assists came in the Premier League and Champions League. That's a goal or an assist every 99.6 minutes. That's not as good as Sergio Aguero's 85.4 this season, but it is pretty much as good, or better, than all of the other best attacking players in the Premier League managed in the PL and Europe. (

* Salah: 108.4
* Mane: 133.8
* Firmino: 137.9
* Aubamayang: 94.1
* Lacazette 102.1
* Hazard: 102.75
* Kane: 115.3
* Son: 119.3

&amp;#x200B;

Now recall that he's at least three years younger than every name on that last, and at least four years younger than all but one (Kane).

&amp;#x200B;

Want comps from the continents (goals + assists per minute in all comps)? How about some of the other best young attackers in Europe like: 

* Timo Werner: 100.3
* Vincius: 108.5
* Luca Jovic: 97.1
* Joao Felix: 92.45

Again, Jesus' mark stands at one every 83.4 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

No, he isn't as good as Kylian Mbappe, who's goal+assist rate of 62.07 feels like a video game glitch, but no one else is. If you're disappointed by Jesus, it's probably not because of HIM, it's probably because you (like me) have been spoiled by watching Sergio Aguero for the past eight years, a man who's a master of turning half chances into goals. Jesus has a long way to go if he's ever to fill that legends boots, and in all likelihood, he never will (because how many people are Aguero?) but that doesn't mean he isn't good enough for us, and it doesn't mean he isn't one of the three or four best young center forwards in the world.",MCFC

However, with two starting-quality center backs leaving the team, I would think that signing a quality central defender would be priority? 

If Otamendi is to leave as expected, our depth at central defender would be:

Laporte
Stones
Mangala
Garcia
Sandler

Two proven starters, one Batmangala, and two unproven U-21 players. Garcia looked quality in preseason but that can only count for so much. Don‚Äôt know much about Sandler. I don‚Äôt know how much you can expect these two players to step up in a season.

4164,1707,1707,City's main transfer targets,"With Vinnie gone and Otamendi also likely to go we need atleast one world class CB. With Ferna and Dave are on their last legs, need to go for a DM atleast. Sane is a doubt :(, in that case need someone as a winger/wide forward.

* GK is sorted with Steffen joining
* RB if Danilo goes need someone who will be handy on either flank and won't mind the bench role. Kenny Lala of Strasbourg is a good shout. Don't think AWB will be a very good purchase as neither him nor Walker will be happy with the bench role. Someone with a hybrid RB/CB profile similar to Joe Gomez/Pavard might be handy.
*CB position needs to be filled in. If Ota is staying we need to go for De Ligt, if that's not working maybe Maguire (but will be very expensive). Ruben Dias being another option. I would also like Eric Garcia to be around and have a Fodenesque role. If ota is leaving I personally prefer some young bargain buy as a 4th CB.
*With Zin/Mendy/Laporte I guess we can atleast skip the need for a LB for one more season.

* DM is a must. I personally would like Rodri, if not NDombele. This should be our marquee signing. Whoever comes will be able to share the minutes with gundo and ferna.

* It seems at this point Gundo is gonna sign for a new contract. In that case I am happy with the CM options if Dave stays. KDB/Gundo for RCM spot which can be further reinforced by Bernardo whenever he is not playing in the flanks. LCM is for Gundo/Silva/Foden.

* If both Sane and Jesus stay we are good in the forward department. If one of them leaves we definitely need someone. I would like a wide forward profile Timo/Joao Felix as age might catch up Aguero at some point. Another wildcard option will be Sebastian Haller, who is valued around 35-40 mills.

*Another point is as Delph is almost certain to leave we need someone to fill the homegrown quota.

Part 2 of 2

And yet I choose to rebel against what an end wants to be. I choose to be grateful for the past but remain ambitious and driven for the future.
For the next 3 years, I will take up the role of Player-Manager of RSC Anderlecht. 
Belgium‚Äôs finest.  

This may come as a surprise to you. 
It‚Äôs the most passionate yet rational decision I‚Äôve ever made.

As a footballer, I was born and raised at RSC Anderlecht. 
Since the age of 6, I have been one with that club.
A history of 34 league titles, they are second to none.

The background to this story‚Ä¶
Belgian entrepreneur Marc Coucke acquired the club from the Vanden Stock family in December 2017.
What followed was a post take-over set back for a club that seemed robust but proved fragile. 
Although the take-over triggered a positive new vibe, sporting results did not follow.

I stopped at their training grounds on my way to international duty last year. Just to say hello.
Coucke, the chairman, and Sports Director Michael Verschueren asked my opinion regarding the difficult situation the club was in.
I shared my thoughts and listened to their vision for the future: ambitious, courageous and determined to get back to n¬∞1.
I offered my help, no strings attached, should they need it.

Later on in the season, newly appointed Technical Director Frank Arnesen joined and we organized some technical sessions on how to build a strong playing identity based on attractive, attacking football. 
RSCA has a tradition of having fantastic youth. 
You could say they have the past and the future, but struggle with the present.

Not so long ago, I took a call from RSC Anderlecht.
Quite unexpectedly, they offered me the position of Player-Manager. 
Michael and Frank explained to me in detail how they saw it working in practice. 
They had thought it through.
Mr. Coucke, the owner, pledged full support: time, budget, framework, staff, facilities ‚Ä¶ 
I was left not only impressed, but also intrigued by this sign of confidence in me. 
It got me thinking. 

The end of this season couldn‚Äôt be more memorable.
I have lived the dream here.  
I have learned so much the last 3 years.
From an incredible manager.
Pep Guardiola reignited my love for the game.
I‚Äôve witnessed, participated, analyzed, absorbed, studied.
Man City play the football I want to play.
It is the football I want to teach and to see played.

I have decided to take up the challenge at RSC Anderlecht.
Player-Manager. 
I want to share my knowledge with the next purple generations.
With that, I will also put a bit of Manchester in the heart of Belgium.

This is no goodbye. It‚Äôs a see you later. 
Et pour les Mauves, voor alle Anderlecht fans: tot binnenkort, √† tr√®s bient√¥t.

Love,

He was a decent player in midfield. Then dropped in deeper as a center back. As Former Manchester City Assistant Mark Bowen put it ""The two players were Pablo Zabaleta [who cost ¬£6.45m from Espanyol, made over 300 appearances and helped win three titles, as many League Cups and an FA Cup] and Vinny Kompany‚Äù. ‚ÄúStraight away you could see he was a leader, a fantastic professional. He was a man‚Äôs man and, although he was a Belgian who had arrived from Germany, he spoke fluent English,‚Äù added Bowen. ‚ÄúHe came across as a proper person, level-headed, someone who would immediately improve the club. Every time Manchester City needed someone to Step up, Vincent Kompany was the one. Our first title win in 44 years. A must win the game against Manchester United. He headed the only goal in that game for us to go and win on the last day of the season and the rest as they say his history. Our second premier league trophy in 2014. Vincent Kompany our captain was there again. Then the persistent injuries came. It's hurt everytime. Mentally it must have been exhausting for him. He came back everytime. He showed his true quality. Both on and off the pitch. Proper Centre half are a dying breed. Vincent Kompany represents the last of them. He perfectly combined strength and technique. Under Pep Guardiola, he's made an impact on the team in a different way less game time. However, every game he plays is a an 8/10 performance. The goal against Leicester City 45 yards away. Everyone in the stadium ""Don't Shot"". He for a second hesitate and then takes the shot on. The strike swerves into the top corner. He has a prominent place in Manchester City folklore.

**Manchester City**

Key City midfielder Fernandinho has been sidelined since suffering a knee injury in the Manchester derby on April 24, and Guardiola said ""we'll see"" when asked if the Brazilian would be fit for the FA Cup Final.

Kevin De Bruyne is in contention after appearing as a late substitute at Brighton following a hamstring issue, while Claudio Bravo (Achilles) remains a long-term absentee.

Benjamin Mendy recently underwent further treatment in Barcelona as he continues to struggle with the after-effects of his latest knee injury.


**Watford**

Watford received good news on Monday as Jose Holebas saw his appeal against the red card received on the final day of the season against West Ham for a last-man foul on Michail Antonio upheld by the FA.

Player of the Season Etienne Capoue returned to the midfield on Sunday after recovering from a groin injury, with only Domingos Quina (shoulder) and Sebastian Prodl (knee) absent.

Obviously he is a young (Dutch) lad so I hope he can get more play time. He only played one season in his professional career yet.

Welcome to the Puma era, and welcome to the first day of the new football season. Isn't it good to be back?

While Zinchenko has been off stalking journalists in California, Mendy has been off sitting on a surgeons table in Barcelona ~~and Pep has been signing contracts in Turin~~, the mod team have been sitting back, can of Carabao in hand, relaxing and recharging, reflecting on the season we've just had.

Inevitably reflecting turns to an itchy desire to inflict our ideals on the community we ~~dictate~~ oversee.

Gabriel Jesus has claimed the number 9 shirt this summer, and to celebrate we thought we would introduce a ninth subreddit rule to commemorate this occasion.

-----

##New Rule - Posts must be descriptive, factual and relevant

There has been a notable decline in the quality of posts and titles recently, and we are looking to nip this in the bud as silly season steps up a gear.

Going forward we will be taking a closer look at posts and titles and removing those that do not meet minimum standards.

###Goals and Other Videos

Eg. Gabriel Jesus scores a goal at the Copa America. You wish to post this to to /r/mcfc and revel in the moment with your fellow City fans. There are a few ways you could post this to the community, but some are better than others:

**A goal should be posted as a video**. Not a screenshot of a goal, not self post with your hot take, not a self post with a link to the video inside. Just post the video as a link, either by uploading to reddit, or by linking to the streamable or alternative provider.

The title is important as well. We will remove poorly thought out titles. **Jesus SCORES A GOAL** will get removed. **Gabriel Jesus goal (1-0 vs Argentina) Copa America** or similar will allow your post to remain, and you will soak up all that sweet sweet karma

###Transfer Rumours, Articles

Going forward all titles must have the source in brackets, where relevant, to start off, for example:

&gt; **[SOURCE] Information (not your opinion) and direct link to either the twitter/article source.**

eg. This is what we are looking for:

&gt; [Sam Lee] Mendy Ruled out for entire season with knee issue

We will be removing posts like this:

&gt; What do we all think of this?

All transfer self posts will be deleted (unless it pertains to an actual discussion of a player rather than a rumour. All transfer related posts will be removed unless presented in the correct format with it being a link + source in brackets.

All **click-bait titles will be removed**. This will help all users quickly see the relevant information at a glance. 

Obviously there will be some small exceptions, please remember to add relevant information to the title and present it as a link to the source, then all is good.

###Match Threads (+ Pre/Post)

It should be obvious which posts are Match Threads and (the same goes for Pre and Post Match Threads).

Fancy starting a pre match thread? Feel free! Add the opponent and the competition to the title, add **[Pre Match Thread]** to the start, add some info to the description about the opponent and lets get the discussion going! The mods will sticky your post and everyone is happy.

Match Threads can be started by the community or with MatchThreader or LiveCommentator. The links for both and how to summon them are in the sidebar. If you do start a match thread yourself, add **[Match Thread]** to the title, and make sure to mention the team we're playing.

Post Match threads gets abused the most, the karma race can lead to some poor titles. We want **[Post Match Thread]** to be at the start, and we want to opponent and score in the title. Anything low effort will be removed, and we will favour a better formatted post. A description is helpful and if you're feeling adventurous, add some goals or highlights to the description.

It is not the responsibility of the mods to post any of these threads, you can do it if you wish. The mods will try and post them if nothing has happened.

###Pictures

We love seeing your pictures of your experience at the ground, or relevant pictures. They should be described properly though. if your picture just says something like **Check This Out!** then we will remove it. If you describe what is in the picture a bit, then we have no reason to remove it and the community know what they're getting before they click on the title. **Just a single emoji as the title is unacceptable.**

If you're going to post a picture of a key moment in the game, have a think about whether it would be better served as a video. The recent example that springs to mind is Jesus's penalty goal in the Copa America, which was posted as a screenshot from before he kicked the ball and offered no value.

###Players Social Media

Sometimes a player does something on social media and you want to post it to our sub. That's great, content is king. Follow the same rules as above. If Mendy has gone on a bender, a sentence explaining what his video contains is valuable information. **Mendy polishes Pep's head with shoe polish** tells me everything I need to know, I'm already salivating at the thought of watching this video. Just calling the video **Lol Mendy absolute bantz** is absolutely useless and will lead to removal.

###Overall

The golden rule is to think about what you're contributing to the community, an extra 10 seconds thinking about your title helps others engage with your content much more easily.

If in doubt, ask.

##Updated Rule - Trolling or Brigading of Rival Subreddits

We have removed a rule referencing the messaging of mods as it was a bit vague and not really enforceable. This has been replaced by a new rule about the trolling or brigading of rival subreddits. This is something we have been enforcing for a while, but not sits as one of our key rules to make yourself familiar with.

It is a simple rule. Any users found to be causing trouble on a rival subreddit, and who are reported to us by that subreddit, will risk being banned from that subreddit as well /r/mcfc as a result. We also report trolls to other subreddits.

This does not affect /r/soccer. Do what you want over there.

-----

##Other Business

A quick reminder of the other 7 rules that we have, they're all visible on the side bar, the link is called **Subreddit rules**.

As before we be removing any comments which are aggressive in nature (Rule: Don't be a dick), and any spam (Rule: Don't spam). Posts that have nothing to do with City will also be removed (Rule: Stay on topic). We are a lenient bunch, so if your post is about the CFG or a wider topic relevant to the club, that is acceptable. Got a really cool bot that you want to show off which says hi to people when they say ""I'm""? That is an unhelpful bot (Rule: No unhelpful bots). That earns the bot a ban.

You are allowed to give the club stick here, and you can complain or point out things you don't like. You can even have a discussion about the moral dilemma you've had to wrestle with by supporting a club owned by someone who is from the Middle East. What you can't do is come in with an anti-city attitude (Rule: No City-bashing). Opinions are fine and respected. Deliberate attempts to cause drama result in a ban.

It would be great if you could post in the relevant thread (Rule: Post in the relevant thread where possible), or create one if you feel it is needed. If there is already a thread about the new Puma kit (there is), then that is the best place for it. New material can have it's own post, and if it is related but warrants it's own post that is fine (like a new video showing Mendy hurting his knee in the new Puma kit). 

Finally, rival fans are still not welcome here, any kind of spamming or non-constructive comment will result in bans, and we do actively report the users to their home team subreddit (Rule: Rival fans must contribute constructively). If you're a rival fan and you genuinely want to ask a question or have a discussion, that is fine, we are a nice bunch. If you want to brag about your team's wonderful defender or point out that the club is financed by slavery, then I'm afraid you'll have to take that elsewhere.

-----

## And Finally

If you see any violations of these rules, please report them to the mods and we will take a look as quickly as possible. If you think you've been unfairly banned or had your post removed, speak to us and we will help resolve the issue.

We hope that you find these rules beneficial going forward and that they help to make the experience on /r/mcfc more enjoyable. As always, feel free to give the mods feedback on these changes.",MCFC

&amp;#x200B;

Now that the season is well and truly over and the new season about to ramp up, I thought I'd take the time to review the players in the squad ahead of the new season. In order to do so, I have collated thousands of tweets, journalistic articles, opinion pieces and data points. I've taken terabytes of Opta data and fed all of this into an advanced AI neural network with machine learning, to come out with the average crowdsourced review of every player, based on fact.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goalkeepers**

&amp;#x200B;

Ederson

*A good goalkeeper capable of stopping shots with his body and also able to kick with his feet. Benefits from having an expensive defense ahead of him. Never been tested.*

Muric

*A goalkeeper. Never been tested.*

Bravo

*Round of applause*

&amp;#x200B;

**Defenders**

&amp;#x200B;

Walker

*A fast right footed player who benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. English. A liability. Never been tested.*

Danilo

*A former Real Madrid player. Never been played. 50 yard screamer sails over the bar*

Stones

*An English defender with girlfriend troubles. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Never been tested.*

Mendy

*Injured. Benefits from being in the most expensive knee surgery in the world.*

Delph

*In the dog house. English. Should be nowhere near Manchester*

Zinchenko

*Not a LB. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Never been tested.*

Mangala

*Ded.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Midfield**

&amp;#x200B;

Sane

*Wants to go to Bayern. Can't track back. Pep doesn't like him. Has a mother. Fast. Long hair.*

Sterling

*Black. Known to buy things. Breakthrough season. English. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world.*

Bernado Silva

*Only won 5 trophies. Can fill in for absentees. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world.*

Silva

*Old. Slow. Magic. Merlin. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world.*

De Bruyne

*De Injure*

Mahrez

*Waste of money. Bench warmer. ¬£60 million on a substitute. Penalty miss.*

Fernandinho

*The second coming of Christ. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Tactical fouls. Shithouserey. Yellow card*

Gundogan

*Present. Not injured. DM. 8. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Turkish. German.*

Foden

*Not being given a chance. Does not benefit from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Should move to obscure German team*

&amp;#x200B;

**Fowards**

&amp;#x200B;

Aguero

*Short. Near post. Not as good as Henry.*

Jesus

*Young. Offside. Benefits from being in the most expensive squad in the world. Never scores. Only scores tap ins.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Manager**

&amp;#x200B;

Guardiola

*Fraud. Fourmidable. Juventus. Hates Sane. Bottles CL. Can't win withough Messi. Benefits from owning the most expensive squad in the world*",MCFC

Ederson

Otamendi - Stones - Laporte

Bernardo - De Bruyne - Rodri - Gundogan - San√©

Jesus - Ag√ºero 


First of all, I would love to see Gabriel Jesus and Ag√ºero playing a full 90 match together. I‚Äôm not sure if it has happened before, but it would be interesting to see how the team would fare with two deadly strikers up front. Second of all, having two people like Rodri and Gundogan would offer a lot of defensive security with a line-up like this considering that the team would have a three man back line. Overall, I just like the idea of seeing Jesus and Ag√ºero playing together in a very offensive line-up.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I will be visiting for a week on September 21st and are trying to determine the best way to make it to the Watford match at the Etihad.  Unfortunately, it looks like we will be on a tight schedule with our plane arriving at London Heathrow @ 10:45am.

&amp;#x200B;

We are wondering if you guys had recommendations on the best ways to get up to the game (right now it says 15:00 (3pm) game time) in a timely fashion.  

* We see that we should have train options that may leave Heathrow at 11:18am and arrive at Manchester Piccadilly at 14:47 (2:27pm).  
   * Is this a reasonable option, are trains usually pretty on time in the area (on a weekend?).  In America that is almost never the case.  
   * We are traveling with backpacks only.  Are there any places to store a backpack during the game?
   * Last time I was in London the customs/immigration went pretty quickly (about 20 minutes) but who knows?

&amp;#x200B;

* We could rent a car and drive up which appears to be about the same time commitment but our concern is about parking around the stadium and whether it is reasonable or if there are tips to parking just far enough away for it to make sense. Again, we are traveling with backpacks only but having a car gives us a place to store our belonging during the game.

&amp;#x200B;

* This one is kind of a long shot, but our friends live in Warrington and we could take the train to Warrington to arrive at 14:14 (2:14pm) and then try to drive the rest of the way (which would save us from having to rent a car and also give us a place to stash out backpacks)

&amp;#x200B;

We also have an option to try to get Everton tickets on the following weekend.  Is that a more reasonable request or should we focus our energy on getting to the Etihad?

Second thing is to have a look around the site. They‚Äôve got explanations of how to sign up and how the game is played. No point in me explaining it here because I‚Äôll just be repeating what they say. It‚Äôs easy to follow. Millions of people play every season. 

Once you‚Äôre signed up you‚Äôll want to join our league. *Best league in the land and all the world!* To do that, you‚Äôll need a code. Our code this season is:

&gt; aeenuv

Once you‚Äôre joined in the league head back to the sub and brag **in this thread** about how awesome your team is. Mines already mint. I‚Äôve got de Bruyne because he‚Äôs gonna boss it this season. There‚Äôs no rules on who you have in your team. If you want mid-table mediocrity to save a few mil then, sure, go for Pogba. Your mistakes are your mistakes. 

Just so we‚Äôre clear, this is for fun. There‚Äôs no fee to enter, it‚Äôs all free, and there are no prizes for winning. You‚Äôll just win the knowledge that you‚Äôre basically the FPL version of Guardiola. Anyone finishing at the bottom, sorry, you‚Äôre basically Tony Pulis. 

Remember it‚Äôs just a laugh so don‚Äôt take it too seriously and don‚Äôt take 6 weeks to pick your team because you might just miss out. **I will be closing entry to the league the day the season starts ie 09/08/19.** You have been warned.

4470,2013,2013,The new long term captain,"I've been thinking a lot about this since David Silva's announcement. Regrettably, I don't think Aguero and Fernandinho will be around for another 2 seasons. These are the three senior players I'd expect to be captain after Kompany however their short term solutions. That leaves the question of who?  They would need to be almost certain starters and have a big presence in the squad. Below are my reasons for and against 3 players that could be in contention. Comment below your thoughts  


**Kevin De Bruyne**

Loved by fans, time and time again Kevin has shown how important he is on the field. To many, he would be the ideal choice. For starters, he's a big game player, scoring winning goals against PSG, United, Chelsea for example. However, I can't help think back to one moment in 2017. Kevin 'loses his cool' at the end of a game against Napoli. Shouting ""Let me talk"" towards David Silva and Fernandinho. He's not afraid to show his emotions, reportedly being furious at Pep for subbing him off against Burton in January 2019. Was this just passion or could his frustrations land him in trouble while dealing with refs every game?

&amp;#x200B;

**Raheem Sterling**

Raheem's career seemed to have stagnated while under Manuel Pellegrini. Luckily for us, Pep Guardiola and influence from Mikel Arteta turned the player from 11 goals and 10 assists in 47 appearances to 25 goals and 18 assists in 51 appearances. But, numbers don't make a captain. In the last few months, he has shown great maturity off the pitch, Donating a large amount towards those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire and accusing the British media of fueling racism. However, do you think Raheem shows this level of maturity on the field? Well, he was given England captaincy for his 50th appearance. Gareth Southgate must see some leadership quality there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Aymeric Laporte**

Laporte played in 35/38 Premier League games last season. A rock at the back he never seems to complain and gets on with the job. A quality you would want from every player. At the moment he a certain starter above all the other centre backs at the club. Does his command at the back make the power defender capable to be the captain or is it too soon to tell in his early City career?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. I'm sure there are a lot more points for and against each of these players that ive not even touched on. Personally, for me it's between Kevin and Raheem however I feel both lack maturity on the field at the moment which can change in the next year in time for Davids departure Maybe could it even be someone else? John Stones? Bernardo Silva? or even Delph???",MCFC

And sterling because he seems very much invested in the club at this point and can fire up the players on the pitch when needed.

4515,2058,2058,Do we really need Maguire?,"With all the reports that have been flying around about us going for Maguire and paying ¬£80m for him, potentially breaking the VVD record fee, I really feel we're going to be criminally overspending on an average defender.

I get Maguire is good and he's experienced and all that jazz. But is it really justified to spend 80m on him? No offence to whoever likes him, but he's really not worth more than 50m. We could easily promote Garcia or Sandler and give them the 4th choice spot, with Fernandinho stepping in when necessary. Dinho was great as a CB when he's been deployed there last season, he has the intelligence as well as the experience and physicality to excel there.

Also, there are a lot more defenders currently, who imo are as good, if not better than Maguire. Skriniar is one. Koulibaly is out of the picture for now sadly, though spending this much on him would be justified. Alderweireld is another really worth candidate. 

We could get Alderweireld for a measly sum who would give us enough backup for a good season which would give Stones and Laporte some more time to cement that partnership. It would also give us time to look at other better options in a year.

Does anyone else feel this is a real waste of money?",MCFC

The crazy rumors of him going to Juve that so many so called ‚ÄúTier 1‚Äù italian journalists got wrong is probably him or Juve laying the groundwork and planting the seed for his eventual arrival, the same way Pep was rumored heavily in Pelligrini‚Äôs last season.

The arrival of Sarri to implement a similar style of play to Pep‚Äôs and to ease the transition from Allegri‚Äôs more rigid style, the same way Pelligrini was seen as a good transition to Pep from Mancini.

The future squad planning. This ones a bit of a reach but Pep was heavily rumored to have chosen Sterling, KDB and Sane while still being Bayern manager.

|Totals|¬£1,391,050,000|¬£434,850,000|-¬£956,200,000|


An average net spend of ¬£88m over the last 11 seasons. I personally HATE net spend. Its for stupid people to use when in reality it ignores so many other pieces of how tranfers are worked on the books. In reality transfers account for a few things:

1) Length of contract

2) Transfer fee

3) Wages

4) Contract Expiry/Transfer Income when said player leaves

Thats how a transfer should be calculated. Looking at transfer at facevalue can be quite silly. To give an example of David Silva who lets say for this argument has been on ¬£200k a week for the entire time he has been here. With a fee off ¬£25m + 9 years at the club + 1 more. David Silva would have served 10 years. Thus his transfer fee on the actual books per accounting terms is 25/10 = a measly ¬£2.5m per year due to amortisation. With 200k a week at ¬£9.6m per year wages David Silva costs Manchester City on the books at ¬£9.6m + ¬£2.5m =¬£12.1m per year. This is one of the reasons City like to extend contracts early in their life so they can further spread the transfer fee over the life of the contract. So in reality the transfer fee of ¬£2.5m per year starts of bigger and gets smaller of time. Its probably closer to ¬£1-2m depending on when his extensions were signed. Gundogan for example who only has 1 year left on his contract per transfer fee amortisation we would have mostly paid off his transfer fee on the books and are almost only at wages. 

Hope thats not confusing!

----------------------

Alas back into our transfer books

The first 3 seasons of our spending in the Mansour era basically went unaccounted for. The owner was basically dumping money into the club left right and centre. A big chunk of our initial spend lies there with us spending a whopping **¬£483,450,000** in those first 3 seasons. This is what I call the ""catch up"" phase. There is no doubt in my mind that Manchester City squad was wayyy behind the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, and Arsenal. So we essentially had to spend a lot to catch up if we wanted to compete with the big clubs. This is the only time you could actually say City were ""ruining football"" and thats purely because the fees at the time were high and we had to spend over the odds to go quick. Though by the 11/12 season we had AGUERRROOOOOd our first PL title.  So fuck it!

## [](#icon-news-big) **FFP implications** 

Manchester City first started to get implications of potential FFP implications around 2011 to 2013 with an eventual fine and squad limitation in 2014. These same issues are cropping up again from the same time period - our books are good in the present but we might again get punished for wrong doings in 2014 (Can I get a fuck UEFA?). This is why in the seasons between 11/12 to 14/15 season we only had a net spend of ¬£180m over 4 years. This is what Khaldoon described as a pinch that effectively slowed City down because they had to get legitimate streams of revenue to do any further club improvement as per the rules City were no longer allowed to get money from Mansour direclty anymore. 

So we effectively have had to do 2 catch up periods due to FFP. We caught up in 11/12 then stagnated back down. Although we won the PL in 2014 just take a look at the 3 seasons afterwards where we only 1 trophy during that period (league cup in 2016, can i get a fuck Liverpool?) as our squad was aging/not good enough. 


##  [](#icon-notes-big) **New TV money + commercial revenue hugely increased**


After that period we finally were able to freely spend again and with the coming of Pep Guardiola it was time to invest wisely in the squad and get back to the top. In the last 4 seasons we have spent a massive **¬£662,900,000** or a netspend of **¬£426,250,000**. A lot of opposing fans will tell you that we must be cheating or the owner is dropping money to do this. 

A netspend of ¬£426,250,000 over 4 years is really not that much with the amount of revenue that comes in. The good thing about City is that the owners DO NOT take money out of the club at all. Every ounce it makes stays within the club. We also have 0 debt. In comparison take a look at what [Uniteds](https://i.redd.it/b4hxwon8ud531.jpg) owners are doing and yet are still able to have a netspend of around ¬£300m in the same time period. 

## [](#icon-notes-big) **Looking at Individual Players** 

I have seen a lot of opposing fans like to claim that Citys buys have always been poor and they just go out and spend another 100m to fix the issue. 

Till this day our record Transfer fee is Riyad Mahrez at ¬£60m 

In the Mansour era we have probably bought around 70-100 players into the first team and obviously most have left or been sold in that time frame. We have also bought a lot of youth who we are starting to see fees coming back from. 

### The bad and TBDs Over the last 11 years 

Suprisingly we havent done too many blunders in our years of spending. You can never nail every transfers for sure but I was acutally suprised how few we have got wrong since the takeover.

|Totals|¬£311,700,000||¬£94,150,000|¬£137,450,000|||¬£79,895,833|


So over 11 years of transfers we have essentially lost ¬£137m to bad transfers. With a lot of those contracts majority spending it out on loan so on the books we probably werent paying their wages but only the bad transfer fee.  (I made up the mangala sell fee of ¬£5m because having that not count here is really bad lol)

The fee spread is a good way to visualise how much it roughly cost us per season on the books. 


Nothings hits me more than when opposing fans say we just buy any and every play at 40-50m and if they dont work we just buy another. Looking at this we have only had a few poor transfers in the last few seasons. Everything else was almost 5 seasons ago.

----------------------------------

## [](#icon-ball)[](#icon-net) **Some stats:**


- In the 11 years since the take over Manchester City have spent  ¬£30m or more a total of only 15 times

- Over ¬£40m a total of 8 times

- Over ¬£50m a total of 4 times

- Over ¬£60m a **grand total of 0 fucken times**

- Of players at or over ¬£30m they have been demed good transfers 13 out of 15 times. Take out Mendy and itll go down to 12 out of 15 times. Thats a success rate of 87% -  pretty good if you ask me. 


With this youll see the club is in immaculately healthy position players and fee wise. 


So when opposing fans tell you Manchester City are ruining football. Tell them kindly to fuck off lol. 

Final note: Rodriguez is about to ruin my over ¬£60m transfer fee due to his ‚Ç¨70m release clause which due to current conversion rates becomes ¬£62.1m (BOOOOO!!!) - Fuck it though he is going to be amazing and is only 22 years old. 5 years in when he is hitting his peak that fee will look tiny when Clubs will be paying ¬£100m for Delph like players.",MCFC

I was checking how well he would be suited to City and his stats say it all. I compared his 18/19 season with 17/18 Fernandinho and 15/16 Busquets. I believe 17/18 and 15/16 were the best seasons for Ferna and Busquets respectively. This is what I found

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From the above stats it is pretty evident that Rodri is defensively almost par with prime Fernandinho and Busquets whereas has scope for improvement offensively. Being 22 and with Pep as his coach, I am pretty confident he can only improve and will become one of the best DMs to have ever played. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sounding optimistic we could have at least one in next week.

I would expect it to be Rodri.

Don't count out de Ligt just yet. The player has asked again about Pep and City.

There are hurdles (some are more obvious than others)

He's feeling the pressure a little in terms of all the interest. Worryingly, Liverpool have also started some sort of charm offensive.

Maguire is considered at least ¬£20m too expensive and doesn't represent the value we want from making City's next centre half the most expensive in the world.

Mino certainly has food for thought.

If Leroy goes, Felix comes. Zinchenko and Walker new deals to be announced when they return.

Muric wanted on loan by two Premier League clubs.

Don't think Otamendi is leaving as things stand, maybe Vinny going has changed that.

No real update on Leroy. Bravo staying for final year.

Just looking for any advice you guys can give me about getting tickets as I don't really know how it works and what the demand is like (I assume it will be pretty high for this game as its the first home game of the season and its Tottenham).

Given the credible nature of some of these sources, what may be the case is Pep has already signed a forward contract with Juve that‚Äôs now sitting in a safe somewhere. What those terms and conditions are, we may never know. What we do know is this is exactly how it happened when Pep joined City from Bayern. Pep had already starting advising City on potential targets as early as a year before he joined. Starling the most famous one. 

Also, most people don‚Äôt remember this, but Bayern fans were shocked and left bitter Pep was leaving. Some players even admitted they were caught unaware. Especially after culling a CL /WC winning squad and never delivering the CL himself. Regardless of the trophies he brings in the coming 2 years, I doubt Pep will want to repeat anything like that again. When he says he is here for another 2 years, I believe him. But I don‚Äôt think he wants us to read too much into it beyond that. 

City is bigger than one man. Our competitive advantage comes from us being a well oiled machine. And that means being good at smoothing out transitions. I think that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening here.

The main points is:

1) City's owner is actually an investor who invests in lot of things (examples are given in the thread), including football. Hence this is an investment not a PR exercise. This is also supported by numbers that city is profittable lsat 4 years. The club value is estimated at 2.2 bn while he says the investment (total) is around 1.3 bn.

&amp;#x200B;

Kun Notes:

\- It's Kun...there's not a lot that you guys aren't well aware of.

\- Insanely consistent bagging 33, 30, then 32 goals. Minute totals of 3500, 2900, and 3400.

\- The threat of GJ was exactly what he needed.

\- Personal opinion for next season is that he plays slightly less minutes and hopefully puts up 34-40 goals as we start bedding in GJ. He could easily get 40+ rotation is obviously key.

&amp;#x200B;

Gabriel Jesus Notes:

\- Embracing the role of deputy with great morale which had to be difficult considering he was first choice not long after coming in on fire and especially with those two injuries.

\- Has a lot of work to do timing his runs and will get better as a finisher. We're blessed with Kun so I think that diminishes Gabby to a degree. The fact of the matter is that he scores goals when he plays and the squad doesn't significantly drop off either.

\- Constantly coming in as a SUB and without a long run of starts weakens his numbers but as a number 2 and potential long term replacement he's been perfect for us these past 2 and a half seasons and I'm not sure that we win two league cups and the FA without him.

\- There's been chatter over the years about fans not being sure if he can lead the line with Kun out and I'm 100% convinced that's bogus. There's also been chatter about not trust him for the big games and that also is 100% bogus. I ran the PL data on games he started / played over 45 minutes and it came back with a 30-4-1 record which is on pace for 102 points. I also ran though those games looking for matches vs top teams and he's excelled every time he's been given the chance. He's started Spurs away, Chelsea away, and vs LFC. We won all 3, he scored 3 and assisted 1. Obviously there was the cup final where he scored 2 and assisted 1 as well.

\- He's not ready yet but I hope he gets more chances in bigger games.

\- Personal Opinion for next season is that he gets close to 2800 minutes and threatens 30 goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Kelechi Notes:

\- Super bummed that it's not working out for him because he always seemed to get the job done when he was called upon. Obviously he had to leave but thanks Kelechi for missing that easy goal vs us!",MCFC

United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has targeted Portugal‚Äôs latest footballing sensation as he begins the rebuilding of his team after a disappointing season.

But he faces fierce competition from Real, who are desperate to land the Benfica teenager, City and also Italian giants Juventus.

Benfica want around ¬£120million and Real have already seen an opening bid of around ¬£80m rejected.

But they are now expected to use Benfica‚Äôs interest in goalkeeper Keylor Navas to try to clinch a deal next week after the finals.

Felix, 19, scored 18 goals in 33 games for Benfica this season and became the youngest player to score a Europa League hat trick since Sergio Aguero when he netted three against Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter finals in April.

The teenager is set to make his senior debut for Portugal against the Swiss in Porto, after being called up for the finals by coach Fernando Santos

**Kick Off:** THE NEXT 24 HOURS GUYS  
**Referee:** /r/soccer  

-----

For the uninitiated, numerous very reliable Italian journalists, including the guy that same CR7 would go to Juventus, have stated that it is certain Pep Guardiola will be announced as Juventus manager on 4th June, with an official unveiling on 14th June. Join us for all the build up to this defining moment of the summer.

All we've had from City's side so far is unreliable guys like a board member and Pep Guardiola denying the claims, so without any credible sources, we can only assume that this is going ahead.

4824,2367,2367,Mendy needs to be replaced or scared into reality,"Benjamin Mendy has only made 17 league appearances in his 2 years on the blue side of Manchester compared to his 1 year in ligue 1 with monoco where he made 8 more appearances with 25. In my opinion he is a liability and Pep Guardiola should highly consider out right replacing him or buying another left-back to put some fear in mendy. I could easily make the argument that with a healthy mendy the title race would've been a lot smoother and maybe we would be talking about champions league glory with that bum rushing, good crossing, and powerful option at left-back. Instead we had an out of position zinchenko at left-back which I must say he did a job but he wasn't mindblowing. It has been said Guardiola will be giving him another chance which I could get behind as long as we go out and buy someone to give him a run for his money. I would be very happy with buying a chilwell or a Tierney from Celtic this would get Mendy off of the social media and focusing on his fitness and his place in the squad. Also we must say the Premier league is a way more physical league then the French league he has already shown to be injury prone so we must get another recruit for that side of the back line. Just to finish this off I should let you know I am a fan of mendy and his abilities he obviously is a world class left back but if we want to continue our dominance in England and progressing in Europe I believe this is a problem position based on Benjamin's attitude and fitness. Anyone agree?",MCFC

Hoeness told the German press (Kicker) that it's about insane price-tags. Hence he does not see the move happening.

4855,2398,2398,Man City identify three midfield summer transfer targets,"Source : Sky Sports


Manchester City are monitoring three midfielders as they continue their pursuit of a replacement for Fernandinho.

According to Manchester evening news,¬†Atletico Madrid midfielder¬†Rodri¬†remains City's No.1 target but the Blues are not pinning all of their hopes on landing the 22-year-old.

Rodri has a release clause of ‚Ç¨70million at Atletico but City are hopeful of signing him for a lower fee.

Should that not be possible City may look elsewhere, with Lyon's¬†Tanguy Ndombele¬†and Real Madrid's¬†Marco Llorente¬†both on the Blues' radar.
Ndombele shone for Lyon in their Champions League win at the Etihad at the beginning of the campaign.

Lyon reportedly rejected a bid from Tottenham for the 22-year-old midfielder earlier this week.

Llorente, meanwhile, endured an injury-ravaged campaign at Madrid and managed just 16 appearances in all competitions.

City are determined to sign Fernandinho's long-term successor this summer after losing out to Chelsea in their pursuit of Jorginho last year.
It had looked for all the world like the Italy international would move to the Etihad only for the lure of moving to London and working with Maurizio Sarri to turn his head at the 11th hour.

Fernandinho turns 35 next season and injury forced him to miss almost a quarter of City's Premier League games over the course of their title-winning campaign.

The Germany international Ilkay Gundogan proved himself to be an able deputy for Fernandinho in the run-in but there are doubts surrounding his long-term future at the club, despite his insistence that he is keen to renew his contract in Manchester.",MCFC

Khaldoon carried on with his studies and was brought in close to the Abu Dhabi royal family as a very trusted advisor. 

Khaldoon has been made CEO of Mubadala which manages 250 billion dollars for Abu Dhabi as his day job:

4934,2477,2477,Would you be happy if City spent more than 100M on a player?,"I know we are labelled as the big spenders but we buy pretty efficiently (well since Pep, Mangala I am looking at you) and can't think of who we need that will strengthen us this summer. Only player I can think of is Kai Havertz, the kid looks something special and would be over 100m, there is obviously Mbappe but i think he has too big an ego for us lot. This has got me thinking because Joao Felix being labelled over 100m is shocking and I would be dissappointed if we pay that. 

Just an FYI - the major player we need to sign is De Ligt and just pay whatever just not over 100m (don't know what it is but triggers me being 3 digits)",MCFC

Despite this, I‚Äôm seeing a lot of pointless moaning. About not being on the front/back pages of papers. About Liverpool getting more credit for the season. About the media bias against City, and the criticism of our owners. Why does any of this matter? Who gives a shit whether we‚Äôre the headline in the Telegraph? Why are we arsed about what boring media heads talking about Liverpool more than us? Why do we automatically assume that reports on our ownership are hit pieces, when there are massive, legitimate concerns with them?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time rolling my eyes at BT and calling McManaman or whoever a twat (he is a fucking twat) but on here it‚Äôs endless complaining about bias and exposure, and it‚Äôs just sad to see.

So with that in mind, and given bernardo's proficiency on the wing, should we be signing a midfielder to replace bernardo, or a winger to replace sane? 

I know we all envisioned bernardo as the dave heir, but it's very clear now that bernardo is not any worse, if not better, on the wing  which is also where pep likes him as of now. 

If we're getting winger, then we we're looking at a ridiculously expensive joao felix. I don't know how i feel about potentially paying more for felix than we're getting for sane. 

If we're getting a MF then there were the talks of bruno earlier that were debunked, as well as whispers tielemans this morning. I would also like to throw Kai Havertz in there. He's really talented and bayern's been after him for some time. Nothing would make me happier than sticking it to bayern after all the shenanigans their boards been pulling.
